This is the second lesson, and you will learn to combine the clutch with the throttle and brake. However, without clutch control, you are going to have difficulty driving a manual car. So if you haven't look at lesson #1, be sure to view this video: https://youtu.be/iW2Q7lIxrRo

EXERCISE #1 - hold the brake with your right foot and bring the clutch out to the friction point with your left. When you're at the friction point, the tachometer will drop 1-200 rpm and you will feel the vehicle vibrate a bit. When you have the clutch at the friction point, the vehicle can now be held by the clutch. Hold the clutch at the friction point and move your right foot from the brake to the throttle. In a gas or petrol engine car, rev the motor up to 1,000-1,200rpm and control the clutch through the friction zone. Move your left foot off the clutch smoothly and as quickly as possible. Take your foot off the clutch to prevent premature wear.

EXERCISE #2 – after developing competency with the first exercise, move reverse gear and do the same exercise. Hold the brake with your right foot and bring the clutch out to the friction point with your left. When you're at the friction point, you will feel the vehicle vibrate a bit. You can't look at the tachometer, because you should be looking out the rear window of the vehicle

That is why it is important to become competent with exercise #1.

Exercise #3 - when you are competent with the first two exercises, move to working the clutch and the brake. In this exercise it is the same as the above: hold the brake with your right foot and bring the clutch out to the friction point with your left. When you're at the friction point, the tachometer will drop 1-200 rpm and you will feel the vehicle vibrate a bit. When you have the clutch at the friction point, the vehicle can now be held by the clutch. Hold the clutch at the friction point and move your right foot from the brake to the throttle. In a gas or petrol engine car, rev the motor up to 1,000-1,200rpm and control the clutch through the friction zone. Move your left foot off the clutch smoothly and as quickly as possible. Take your foot off the clutch to prevent premature wear.

Now you're going to throttle up to 2,000-3,000 rpm and then move right foot from the throttle and brake down to 1,000rpm. When the tachometer goes to 1,000 rpm push the clutch in and bring the vehicle to a complete stop.

Exercise #4 - when you are competent with the first three exercises, move to working the clutch and the brake in reverse. In this exercise it is the same as the above: hold the brake with your right foot and bring the clutch out to the friction point with your left. When you're at the friction point, you will feel the vehicle vibrate a bit. You won't be able to look out the tachometer, because you must be looking out the rear window. When you have the clutch at the friction point, the vehicle can now be held by the clutch. Hold the clutch at the friction point and move your right foot from the brake to the throttle. In a gas or petrol engine car, rev the motor up to 1,000-1,200rpm and control the clutch through the friction zone. Move your left foot off the clutch smoothly and as quickly as possible. Take your foot off the clutch to prevent premature wear.

Now you're going to throttle up to 2,000-3,000 rpm and then move right foot from the throttle and brake down to 1,000rpm. When the tachometer goes to 1,000 rpm push the clutch in and bring the vehicle to a complete stop.

When you have the clutch at the friction point, the vehicle can now be held by the clutch. Hold the clutch at the friction point and move your right foot from the brake to the throttle. In a gas or petrol engine car, rev the motor up to 1,000-1,200rpm and control the clutch through the friction zone. Move your left foot off the clutch smoothly and as quickly as possible. Take your foot off the clutch to prevent premature wear.

If you are driving a vehicle fitted with a manual transmission, the specific gears, their speeds and the revs of the engine will be in the owner's manual. If you are driving an older vehicle, the owner's manual will be in paper form, early-2000s, the owner's manual will be electronic, and if you have a new vehicle with telematics, the owner's manual will be on the vehicle's display.
When shifting a manual transmission for fuel economy: the lowest rev/rpm for the highest gear will give you maximum fuel economy. As well, the faster you get through the gears, this technique too will give you better fuel economy.
Think strategically about where you're going to practice to learn to shift through the gears. Start off in a parking lot or other quiet area where there isn't too much traffic and you can concentrate on shifting the transmission.
When shifting through the gears, take your foot off the throttle, depress the clutch pedal, move the gear selector, and then let the clutch out to the friction point and control the clutch through the friction zone. When you've completely released the clutch, then depress the throttle. This technique will extend the life of your clutch.
In most 4-cylinder petrol engines you will shift at approximately 2,500-3,000 rpm. If you are driving a 4-cylinder diesel engine, you will shift at approximately 1,200-1,500 rpm. These are just general starting points.
As you get more and more experience driving a manual transmission, you will hear the engine and not have to look at the tachometer as much to know when to shift the vehicle.
To make right hand turns, most often you will shift down to second gear to go around the corner. For left-hand turns, most of the time you will shift down to third gear to go around the corner.

When you are less than 1,000 rpm can I step on the clutch first before I can step on the brake to stop the car smoothly? or I need to step on the brake first before stepping on the clutch? My problem is I am not stopping the car smoothly because I used to step on the clutch first before braking.
> Step on the brake first to bring the tachometer down to approximately 1,000 rpm. You'll hear the motor start to re-engage with the drive train. When you learn when that point is on your vehicle--usually 900-1,000--you push the clutch in and come to a complete stop.

Essentially first gear is for putting vehicle in motion or for starting on an incline. Vehicle is brought to a standstill in second gear because shifting to first from second gear with vehicle in motion can actually damage the gearbox. Is skipping gears when downshifting recommendable?
> One of the things that you have to do when shifting a manual transmission is match the road speed to the gear. If you're going slow enough--below 10kph or 5mph--you  can shift to first gear. If you're going faster than that road speed--yes--you could potentially damage the transmission. And yes, you can skip gears in a manual transmission. It doesn't happen very often in a passenger vehicle, but when turning right, you can shift from 4th to 2nd gear, and we'll see that in the next lesson. As well if you're going down a hill, you can shift from 2nd to 4th gear and just "feather" the throttle.

Maybe my car is different, or I havent gotten clutch control down yet. But when shifting through the gears I have to press clutch, shift and give GAS, Before clutch is completely out. Or at least that's the way it feels. 
If I let clutch all the way out then gas, the car jerks.
Also at low speeds say through a parking lot, what's it mean when the car is almost skipping, usually second gear.
> What kind of vehicle do you have? For the first issue I believe that you are right about the clutch control. Because you do have to control the clutch through the friction point to get a smooth shift. If you continue to give throttle when letting out the clutch after first gear, you'll prematurely wear out the clutch. If the car is skipping at low speeds, I would think that the road speed is too low for the gear. If there is anything further we can do, drop us a note. Always happy to help. All the best, Cheers Rick.

When you come to a complete stop you’re supposed to be on 1st not neutral? And also near the end when you were on 4th gear and went into 2nd you skipped 3rd gear? Are we allowed to skip gears?
> Come to a complete stop in whatever gear you're in, and when the vehicle comes to a complete stop, shift the selector back to first gear in preparation to go. And yes, you can skip gears. All the best, Cheers Rick.

Prolong the life of your clutch by putting the transmission into neutral when waiting at a light.
