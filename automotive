This is the second lesson, and you will learn to combine the clutch with the throttle and brake. However, without clutch control, you are going to have difficulty driving a manual car. So if you haven't look at lesson #1, be sure to view this video: https://youtu.be/iW2Q7lIxrRo

EXERCISE #1 - hold the brake with your right foot and bring the clutch out to the friction point with your left. When you're at the friction point, the tachometer will drop 1-200 rpm and you will feel the vehicle vibrate a bit. When you have the clutch at the friction point, the vehicle can now be held by the clutch. Hold the clutch at the friction point and move your right foot from the brake to the throttle. In a gas or petrol engine car, rev the motor up to 1,000-1,200rpm and control the clutch through the friction zone. Move your left foot off the clutch smoothly and as quickly as possible. Take your foot off the clutch to prevent premature wear.

EXERCISE #2 – after developing competency with the first exercise, move reverse gear and do the same exercise. Hold the brake with your right foot and bring the clutch out to the friction point with your left. When you're at the friction point, you will feel the vehicle vibrate a bit. You can't look at the tachometer, because you should be looking out the rear window of the vehicle

That is why it is important to become competent with exercise #1.

Exercise #3 - when you are competent with the first two exercises, move to working the clutch and the brake. In this exercise it is the same as the above: hold the brake with your right foot and bring the clutch out to the friction point with your left. When you're at the friction point, the tachometer will drop 1-200 rpm and you will feel the vehicle vibrate a bit. When you have the clutch at the friction point, the vehicle can now be held by the clutch. Hold the clutch at the friction point and move your right foot from the brake to the throttle. In a gas or petrol engine car, rev the motor up to 1,000-1,200rpm and control the clutch through the friction zone. Move your left foot off the clutch smoothly and as quickly as possible. Take your foot off the clutch to prevent premature wear.

Now you're going to throttle up to 2,000-3,000 rpm and then move right foot from the throttle and brake down to 1,000rpm. When the tachometer goes to 1,000 rpm push the clutch in and bring the vehicle to a complete stop.

Exercise #4 - when you are competent with the first three exercises, move to working the clutch and the brake in reverse. In this exercise it is the same as the above: hold the brake with your right foot and bring the clutch out to the friction point with your left. When you're at the friction point, you will feel the vehicle vibrate a bit. You won't be able to look out the tachometer, because you must be looking out the rear window. When you have the clutch at the friction point, the vehicle can now be held by the clutch. Hold the clutch at the friction point and move your right foot from the brake to the throttle. In a gas or petrol engine car, rev the motor up to 1,000-1,200rpm and control the clutch through the friction zone. Move your left foot off the clutch smoothly and as quickly as possible. Take your foot off the clutch to prevent premature wear.

Now you're going to throttle up to 2,000-3,000 rpm and then move right foot from the throttle and brake down to 1,000rpm. When the tachometer goes to 1,000 rpm push the clutch in and bring the vehicle to a complete stop.

When you have the clutch at the friction point, the vehicle can now be held by the clutch. Hold the clutch at the friction point and move your right foot from the brake to the throttle. In a gas or petrol engine car, rev the motor up to 1,000-1,200rpm and control the clutch through the friction zone. Move your left foot off the clutch smoothly and as quickly as possible. Take your foot off the clutch to prevent premature wear.

If you are driving a vehicle fitted with a manual transmission, the specific gears, their speeds and the revs of the engine will be in the owner's manual. If you are driving an older vehicle, the owner's manual will be in paper form, early-2000s, the owner's manual will be electronic, and if you have a new vehicle with telematics, the owner's manual will be on the vehicle's display.
When shifting a manual transmission for fuel economy: the lowest rev/rpm for the highest gear will give you maximum fuel economy. As well, the faster you get through the gears, this technique too will give you better fuel economy.
Think strategically about where you're going to practice to learn to shift through the gears. Start off in a parking lot or other quiet area where there isn't too much traffic and you can concentrate on shifting the transmission.
When shifting through the gears, take your foot off the throttle, depress the clutch pedal, move the gear selector, and then let the clutch out to the friction point and control the clutch through the friction zone. When you've completely released the clutch, then depress the throttle. This technique will extend the life of your clutch.
In most 4-cylinder petrol engines you will shift at approximately 2,500-3,000 rpm. If you are driving a 4-cylinder diesel engine, you will shift at approximately 1,200-1,500 rpm. These are just general starting points.
As you get more and more experience driving a manual transmission, you will hear the engine and not have to look at the tachometer as much to know when to shift the vehicle.
To make right hand turns, most often you will shift down to second gear to go around the corner. For left-hand turns, most of the time you will shift down to third gear to go around the corner.

When you are less than 1,000 rpm can I step on the clutch first before I can step on the brake to stop the car smoothly? or I need to step on the brake first before stepping on the clutch? My problem is I am not stopping the car smoothly because I used to step on the clutch first before braking.
> Step on the brake first to bring the tachometer down to approximately 1,000 rpm. You'll hear the motor start to re-engage with the drive train. When you learn when that point is on your vehicle--usually 900-1,000--you push the clutch in and come to a complete stop.

Essentially first gear is for putting vehicle in motion or for starting on an incline. Vehicle is brought to a standstill in second gear because shifting to first from second gear with vehicle in motion can actually damage the gearbox. Is skipping gears when downshifting recommendable?
> One of the things that you have to do when shifting a manual transmission is match the road speed to the gear. If you're going slow enough--below 10kph or 5mph--you  can shift to first gear. If you're going faster than that road speed--yes--you could potentially damage the transmission. And yes, you can skip gears in a manual transmission. It doesn't happen very often in a passenger vehicle, but when turning right, you can shift from 4th to 2nd gear, and we'll see that in the next lesson. As well if you're going down a hill, you can shift from 2nd to 4th gear and just "feather" the throttle.

Maybe my car is different, or I havent gotten clutch control down yet. But when shifting through the gears I have to press clutch, shift and give GAS, Before clutch is completely out. Or at least that's the way it feels. 
If I let clutch all the way out then gas, the car jerks.
Also at low speeds say through a parking lot, what's it mean when the car is almost skipping, usually second gear.
> What kind of vehicle do you have? For the first issue I believe that you are right about the clutch control. Because you do have to control the clutch through the friction point to get a smooth shift. If you continue to give throttle when letting out the clutch after first gear, you'll prematurely wear out the clutch. If the car is skipping at low speeds, I would think that the road speed is too low for the gear. If there is anything further we can do, drop us a note. Always happy to help. All the best, Cheers Rick.

When you come to a complete stop you’re supposed to be on 1st not neutral? And also near the end when you were on 4th gear and went into 2nd you skipped 3rd gear? Are we allowed to skip gears?
> Come to a complete stop in whatever gear you're in, and when the vehicle comes to a complete stop, shift the selector back to first gear in preparation to go. And yes, you can skip gears. All the best, Cheers Rick.

Prolong the life of your clutch by putting the transmission into neutral when waiting at a light.

How to do a Hill Start in a Manual Car | Manual Transmission Smart

Spin the tyres on a hill start?? Wow, instant fail in Australia. Apply handbrake, gently on the gas, clutch to friction point as you're releasing the handbrake. Much, much easier, very controlled and prevents stalling.
> Hi Al Uishious - Thank you for your comment. That part of the video wasn't really for license purposes. It was to show drivers how to preserve the clutch on their vehicle - especially new drivers that don't understand that they can damage the clutch by not getting the clutch out quickly. I lived in Australia - there really aren't hills per se in that country - more gentle grades. These hills I'm on here in Vernon, BC are 16% grade - a lot of throttle is required to get the vehicle started. And due to the amount of throttle required, you're either going to spin the clutch or the tires - better the tires than the clutch. All the best, Cheers Rick.
> Hi Al Uishious - Thank you for your comment. And you are so right about the disparity. Here on YouTube, I've become an international driving instructor, and I'm always working to understand other driving cultures. I believe that one of the major differences that make one 2L massive and the other smaller is the size of the vehicle. The vehicles themselves in Europe are smaller, which increase the horsepower to weight ratio. In my Honda CRV, the 2L is balanced for the vehicle; that engine is by no means "peppy".  More like, the little engine that could!!  80) All the best my friend, Cheers Rick.

Question: Does your clutch overheats  when holding it all the way down for a  while, Especially on  uphill traffic?
> Hi Jonathan Suniga - Apologies for the late response. Thank you for your query. No, you won't overheat your clutch when you have the pedal depressed. It will overheat if you don't get the clutch out all the way quickly when applying the throttle. If there is anything further we can do, drop us a note. Always happy to help. All the best, Cheers Rick.

When parking on an up hill or down hill what gear should the vehicle be in?
> Most of the time I put it in 1st gear.

i managed to identify the biting point...yet when i step off the breaks and try to maneuver the engine goes off. not sure if its because i stepped on the excel too quick or what!? the car didn't stall but the engine went off. i'm watching all the way in South Africa. thanks.
> Hi Marching - thanks for your comment and query. I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "the engine went off." For the purposes of hill starts, you have to give the engine a lot of throttle in the instant you release the clutch. You might try applying the parking brake--if it's a hand lever--and getting the clutch to the biting point, give the engine lots of throttle, and then releasing the parking brake - that might work as a better technique for you. Let me know how it goes. All the best, Cheers Rick.

Smart Drive Test I love your videos a whole lot. I'd just like to point out something about your handbrake method. When you are  a beginner learning to drive manual on a hill there are two things you have to worry about when starting from a stop. Stalling and Rolling back. The English handbrake method is supposed to remove the risk of both of these things occurring, your method basically still carries with it the risk of stalling. In fact your handbrake method is the exact same as your footbrake method in my opinion. The true handbrake method does NOT require you to bring the clutch up to its biting point/friction zone until AFTER you set the gas to maybe about 2500-3000 rpm. Since engine rpm is above idling which is about 1000rpm even if you bring the clutch up higher your car is not going to be at risk of stalling, in fact we are mostly aware that you can drive your vehicle with the handbrake engaged. In both of your methods you find the biting point before setting the gas and a learner who comes a little bit more off the clutch not being aware that they are already at the biting point will stall. A benefit of the English method is with respect to driving a new car with a different bite point you will not risk stalling. Just like learning to drive manual for the first time if you practice this enough it soon becomes second nature and you could come to a complete stop and move off within a second or two with no rollback and no risk of stalling.
> ou are correct my friend; however, it is important to work on habits that are going to prolong the life of your vehicle and its clutch. If you set the throttle to 2-3,000rpm and then release the clutch, you're going to wear out the two plates in the clutch assembly that come togeter and connect the engine to the transmission. With extended driving with setting the throttle first, you'll have to replace the clutch between 1-150,000 kilometres. Always best to get to the friction point, apply the throttle and get the clutch out as quickly as possible. See this video for more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4AW_1hz6Rg&list=PL0x-bChcUvwE4covDy04Sre8cPPb-q4HL&t=6s&index=3 If there is anything further we can do, drop us a note. Always happy to help. All the best, Cheers Rick.

* hill start with parking brake especially in congestion is not possible, it's better to practice with your way.
> Suspect some drivers in the UK may disagree with you. They use the handbrake all the time; not just for hill starts. I think it is usually determined by the driving culture. The method I use is what I'm familiar with. If I had been taught the other method I might do that, because after you do it a couple of times it's not too hard. And the newer standard vehicles are really easy to get going on hills - relatively speaking of course. If there is anything further we can do, drop us a note. Always happy to help. All the best, Cheers Rick.

Your no handbrake hill start method may not work when the road is wet would it?
> Both methods are going to work for the hill start. You may spin the tires, which is what you want to get the vehicle going. And it is going to depend on how steep the hill is too. But you need to get the clutch out as quickly as possible to avoid burning out the clutch.

i noticed you don't use the heel to control the biting point is this the right way to do it?
> If you can place your heel on the floor & use your toes or the ball of your foot you’ll have more control of the clutch.
