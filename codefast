Nothing Matters More Than Coding Fast
Learn Programming FAST:
The best way to learn programing is by fighting your way to your goals . Do everything that you shouldn't, don't follow any rules or tutorial step by step . Get a task that is basically achievable with your knowledge and break your head on it and on upgrading it with various creative ideas that come to your mind . The code is yours the program is yours , learn how to use your tools, learning the tools themselves is a scenario of opening google and looking at Documents. The best way to learn is to fight with it until you get what you want, that way you know how to deal with the mechanic of the technology you are using. If you follow something step by step, sooner or later you’ll have to cut the safety cables that you get from your tutorial and learn to fly. And when that moment comes, you got no choice but to deal with the machine it self. Doing this from the start is much faster than slowly following step by step a tutorial and then slowly slowly trying to do Extra stuff and at the end having to fight your way to your goals. Better to start by fighting with the machine. It may seem hard but if you have the right knowledge you’ll just learn a lot from your mistakes.
