You can also press ⌘ CMD+⇧ SHIFT+G and type the path to the hidden folder, just like in Terminal (⇥ TAB autocompletion also works).

Finder QuickView: Space bar:
Select an item in the Finder by clicking on it, then press the space bar. Regardless of the type of file, QuickView displays it in detail in a window without launching an app. For an image file, it displays the image and offers to open it in Preview, while something created in a particular application (a Pages document, for example) displays the preview and provides a button for opening it in that app.

To navigate backwards and forwards in Finder, use Command + [  to go back and Command + ] to go forwards. This also works in Safari to move between your page history.

Open Folders or Go Up a Level in Finder
Many tasks you do each day probably involve Finder, so it’s immensely useful to be able to open folders or go back up a level using only the keyboard:
Command + up takes you up a level in the folder structure
Command + down opens the current folder in the same window
Another useful shortcut is Command + ` (next to the left Shift key) to swap between an application’s open windows. This is handy if you have multiple Finder windows open. Alternatively, use the swipe up/down gesture to use Exposé/Mission Control to switch between the desired Finder window.

⌘ ↓
Select Files in Finder The Easy Way
To select a file in the current Finder folder, begin typing the name of the file and the active item will update to match what you’ve just typed. Alternatively, the arrow keys can be used to move the selection; press the Spacebar to preview a selected item, Command + Down to open an item, or Command + I to get more information.

.aat -> Apple Advanced Typography
AAT font features do not alter the underlying typed text; they only affect the characters' representation during glyph conversion.

Developed jointly by Adobe and Microsoft, OpenType (.otf, .ttf, .ttc) fonts improves upon Microsoft's TrueType fonts, by incorporating a greater extension of the basic character set, adding a more robust data structure for prescribing better typographic behavior. This includes small capitalization, old-style numerals, and more detailed shapes, such as glyphs and ligatures. OpenType fonts are single files that can also be scaled to any size, are clear and readable in all sizes, and can be used on both Macintosh and Windows platforms without conversion. Designers will benefit from OpenType over previous formats due to the much larger character set and for the programs that support it: automatic alternative character and ligature support.

Hard water furred the kettle.

The symbol, which I can never find on Microsoft Word's symbol list, is a hollow square with a single, vertical line through the middle. It's placed at the end of a number, such as 2,550[I] but imagine the box/line as intersecting and the top/bottom of the vertical line extending outside the box at both top and bottom. (I had to play with brackets, here) and either the same size font of the numbers or smaller, but never larger (not meant to overshadow the numbers). It's very common in the construction and architecture industry- especially when handwriting instructions or notes in order to avoid having to 'read' someone's handwriting (plus, it takes up slightly less space). For whatever reason, it's not available in most font/symbol options.

gdb:
gdb -tui [executable's name]
break [line number]

break [file name]:[line number]

break [function name]

break [line number] if [condition]
For example,
break 11 if i > 97

place a "watchpoint" which will pause the program if a variable is modified:
watch [variable]

Once our breakpoints are set, we can run the program with the "run" command, or simply:
r [command line arguments if your program takes some]
as most words can be abbreviated in just a letter with gdb.

bt
for backtrack will tell us how we got to that point.

info locals
will display all the local variables and their current values (as you can see I didn't set my d variable to anything so its value is currently garbage).

to list the breakpoints in a program, which can be done by typing info breakpoints
Breakpoints can be deleted by typing delete # where # is the number of the breakpoint gotten from info breakpoints
GDB can also print the backtrace (or bt) at any time, telling you what the current call stack looks like
If you don't want to type out the whole command in gdb, it'll understand shorthand, like r for run or b for breakpoint, d for delete; you can do this for almost all commands in GDB!

p [variable]
will show the value of a particular variable. But even better:

ptype [variable]
shows the type of a local variable. So here we can confirm that d is double type.

set var [variable] = [new value]

step
to run the next line and potentially step into a function. Or just:

next
to just go straight to the line below, ignoring any function call.

help <command>

delete a breakpoint with:
delete [line number]

Keep running the program from the current breakpoint with:
continue

and exit GDB with:
quit

bugbears of russian grammar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltdv2kymcZo
11:11 Russian Case system.
18:22 Verbs of motion in Russian.
19:18 Aspect of verbs in Russian.
David Emerling 3 years ago (edited)
As for as verbs go, in Russian, it is only through context that many of the nuances of English sentences can be conveyed. 
He works.
He is working.
He worked.
He was working.
He has worked.
He has been working.
He had worked.
He had been working.
He will work
He is going to work.
He will be working.
He will have worked.
He will have been working.
He would work.
He would be working.
He would have worked.
He would have been working.

In Russian, you basically have:
Он работает. (This could mean either "He works" or "He is working")
Он работал.
Он будет работать.
Он работал бы.

As in all languages, there is nothing better than immersion. But, since that is not always possible, one must make the effort to listen, read and speak the language as much as possible. This is where the internet is a great resource!

Russian grammatical rules can be characterized as follows: "The good news is that they have very few exceptions to their rules. The bad news is that they have a bazillion rules."

Getting some formal grammatical education in Russian will vastly accelerate your learning because it will reduce your level of frustration. Without some of this type of formal exposure to their grammatical structure, the language will seem arbitrary.

For instance, the word for "book" in Russian is книга. (pronounced K-NEE-ga). But when you see that word used in various sentences, you can become confused if you do not understand the various cases as described in this excellent video.

Try to find the word for "book" in each of the following sentences, paying close attention to how it is spelled. And, this is just a few examples.

Это очень интересная книга.
This is a very interesting book.

Она читает интересную книгу.
She is reading an interesting book.

Она никогда не читает интересних книг.
She never reads any interesting books.

Мы разговариваем о интересной книге.
We аre discussing an interesting book.

Он всегда ходит в парк со свой любимой книгой.
He always goes to the park with his favorite book.

One thing that has helped my listening comprehension is that I listen to Russian podcasts. There is one, in particular, that has Russian audio books, Радио Фантастики (Radio Fantastica). There is even an app for it, I listen to it with headphones as I walk my dog.

Good luck to anybody trying to learn this language! The points brought out in this video are very good. I have developed a pretty good feel for the grammatical cases and verb aspects but I still hate verbs-of-motion.

Как Ваши успехи в изучении русского на сегодняшний день?

difference between Ш and Щ:
1. Ш - is basically the same as Sh in English. Щ is a sound between Ш and S. I personalty find It is quite similar to Japanese し(shi) which is not exactly shi but more of a mixture between shi and si.

2. These are two different sounds, not "two kinds of sh"! How can someone not hear it? First time they told me this I thought it was a joke. It's like confusing "Iraq" with "Iran" )) I spoke to one Brit who was learning Russian, and he didn't realize that the soft sign in the end of words like "ночь", "дочь" etc are only the indication of gender, but the "ч" itself is always soft. He thought we had two different sounds, like in Serbian. Also, I found out  that most English speakers tend to "de - emphasize" grammar, simply because they don't know it. Most of them cannot tell a participle from an adjective in their own language, or even have no idea about how many tenses it has. This is, probably, the result of their education, that focuses on "spelling" (memorizing words without analyzing their morphological structure). So when they learn Russian, they expect it to be the same - irrational language with no rules. But this is so different from how we are taught. In a Russian school there is no "spelling". The course is called "morphology and orthography", which is followed by "syntax and punctuation". Just like that - in order to know orthography you have to know morphology, and in order to know punctuation you need to study syntax first. And there is no way to de-emphasize it.

I am Polish and I have to say that Russian is EZ once you overcome the alphabet problem. Russian has one case less than Polish, there is way less rule exceptions in it and the orography isn't as insane as in Polish. The most difficult thing about Russian was learning how to accent specific vowels precisely, because in Polish the stress is almost always at the second to last syllable, but most importantly nobody cares nor thinks about it and even if speak everything flat it is still ok.

perfective aspect in russian along with finished action also delivers terminative meaning e.g.
seek - искать - process (durative)
find - найти     - process is finished and can't last anymore and has nothing to do with present action  (terminative)
examples are not very good(they are of different roots lol ), but they reveal core of this grammar issue.
It is often confused with present perfect which of course has nothing to do with the subject. beacause in english perfect the question "whether action is finished" remains open.

45 common Russian conjunctions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4uRED9MLI
"Da" means "Yes." But this video is about conjunctions. So, there is also a conjunction "da" which can mean "and" or "but."
Да, тут без ста грамм интуристу не разобраться! Хотел было ответить развёрнуто, да время поджимает: в магазин нужно бежать, да пса выгулять, уж извини. Да прибудет с тобой сила, брат! :)
Внимание вопрос: к какой части речи относится каждое из употреблённых мною слов "да" и какое несут смысловое значение?
ЗЫ: Переводить, полагаю, смысла никакого нет?)

Lol, remember learning достопримечательности, it's 21 letters and I always missed that soft sign after chatel.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDTthaug-GY
2 grammatical categories which you should understand prior to Russian cases learning. Those categories are gender and number. So, before dealing with cases, which is a completely new concept for most of you and that’s why pretty difficult to grasp, it’s highly recommended to become comfortable with a gender and a number concepts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwIHIGBsm3A
Obviously (as the title of the video suggests), in this video, we are going to speak about Russian declension. If you ask me, “What this declension has to do with Russian cases?”, my answer will be, “Everything.”
When beginners say a phrase like “Russian cases,” or when they say that “Russian cases are difficult,” they actually mean a declension (they just don’t know how to call it properly, so they call it “cases”). So, not the cases are hard for them but this Russian declension.

Usually, Russian learners emphasize the stressed syllable exactly the same as they would do it in their native language which, to tell the truth, sounds not exactly the same as Russian native speakers do things. And this causes accent.
Also, when you start learning Russian grammar, you discover (with astonishment) that Russian stress is mobile. It can move in the same word when this word alters in different cases, conjugations, forms, genders… Which some people find pretty confusing.
Plus, when learning new words, you realize that stress sometimes influences meaning. There are words that are written exactly the same but have different stressed syllables and, therefore, have completely different meanings.

Mastering C++ Multithreading by Maya Posch 
English | 2017 | ISBN: 1787121706 | 244 Pages | True PDF, EPUB, AZW3 | 10 MB

Master multithreading and concurrent processing with C++
Multithreaded applications execute multiple threads in a single processor environment, allowing developers achieve concurrency. This book will teach you the finer points of multithreading and concurrency concepts and how to apply them efficiently in C++.
Divided into three modules, we start with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of multithreading and concurrency concepts. We then take an in-depth look at how these concepts work at the hardware-level as well as how both operating systems and frameworks use these low-level functions.
In the next module, you will learn about the native multithreading and concurrency support available in C++ since the 2011 revision, synchronization and communication between threads, debugging concurrent C++ applications, and the best programming practices in C++.
In the final module, you will learn about atomic operations before moving on to apply concurrency to distributed and GPGPU-based processing. The comprehensive coverage of essential multithreading concepts means you will be able to efficiently apply multithreading concepts while coding in C++.
What You Will Learn

Deep dive into the details of the how various operating systems currently implement multithreading
Choose the best multithreading APIs when designing a new application
Explore the use of mutexes, spin-locks, and other synchronization concepts and see how to safely pass data between threads
Understand the level of API support provided by various C++ toolchains
Resolve common issues in multithreaded code and recognize common pitfalls using tools such as Memcheck, CacheGrind, DRD, Helgrind, and more
Discover the nature of atomic operations and understand how they can be useful in optimizing code
Implement a multithreaded application in a distributed computing environment
Design a C++-based GPGPU application that employs multithreading.

This accessible textbook is a “must-read” for programmers of all levels of expertise. Basic familiarity with concepts such as operations between vectors and matrices, and the Newton-Raphson method for finding the roots of non-linear equations, would be an advantage, but extensive knowledge of the underlying mathematics is not assumed.

Removing App Library Files, Caches, & Preferences
Some applications will also leave behind some preference files and caches, generally these don’t harm anything to leave around, but if you want to delete them it’s just a matter of locating the apps support files and removing those as well. If you’d rather not dig around in these files yourself, you can turn to a utility like AppCleaner to delete the application along with all of it’s respective scattered preference files, but for those who would like to do this on their own, you can typically found these type of files in the following locations.
Application Support files (can be anything from saved states, preferences, caches, temporary files, etc):
~/Library/Application Support/(App Name)

Preferences are stored at:
~/Library/Preferences/(App Name)

Caches are stored in:
~/Library/Caches/(App Name)

branch in Git is in actuality a simple file that contains the 40 character SHA-1 checksum of the commit it points to, branches are cheap to create and destroy. Creating a new branch is as quick and simple as writing 41 bytes to a file (40 characters and a newline).

Fork the project
Make one or more well commented and clean commits to the repository. You can make a new branch here if you are modifying more than one part or feature.
Perform a pull request in github's web interface.
if it is a new Feature request, don't start the coding first. Remember to post an issue to discuss the new feature.

If the feature is well discuss and there are some +1 or the project owner approved it, assign the issue to yourself, then do the steps above.

Some projects won't use the pull request system. Check with the author or mailing list on the best way to get your code back into the project.

Once you have forked a project, you can develop in any branch you want (a new one, or one from the original project)

Remember to:

add the original project as a remote (different form 'origin', since origin would be your own repo, result of the fork)
rebase your branch on top of the branch of the original repo you want to contribute.
It is important your pulling request result in fast-forward merges.
See for instance:
"Pull new updates from original Github repository into forked Github repository". https://stackoverflow.com/a/3903835/6309

which HuaWei smartphone has built-in FM tuner?
Which Android phones have offline FM radio?

Antennas
Phones with built-in radio tuners require an antenna to pick up the FM signal. The headset is used as the antenna, and this is why headsets must be connected to the phone to gain a signal. The same principle works when connecting the mobile with a jack-to-jack or jack-to-phono cable to a stereo system.

Standalone FM Radio Headsets
For phones without built-in FM radio, there is always the option to purchase a standalone FM radio headset. There are many FM radio headsets available, which connect to the phone via Bluetooth or via the headphone socket. These are a popular option for receiving FM radio on phones that do not come with built-in receivers.

"Боловсролгүй боловсрол" гэх шиг зүйл ярьж байна. Энд нэг санаагаа хэлэхэд. Тэр цаана нь байгаа зүйл чинь билэг гэдэг ойлголт байх аа, уламжлалт ойлголтоор. Билэг гэдэг нь "арга" буюу бидний ойлголтоор материаллаг нөхцлийн эсрэг тал нь болов уу. Тэхээр оюун санааны дээгүүр түвшнийг билэг гэж хэлж байна гэж ойлгож болох байх аа. Түүнд байгалиас тухайн хүнд илүүтэй өгөгдсөн увдисаар хүрч болох юм. Эсвэл системтэй боловсролоор. Гэхдээ аль ч тохиолдолд хувь хүний өөрийн эрэгцүүлэл, бясалгал, хичээл чармайлт, сэтгэлгээний хүч асар их ташуур болно. Аливаа хүн байгаа бодит бололцоон дээрээ тулгуурлаад оюун чадвараа ашиглаад ямар нэг зүйл бүтээх буюу аливаа асуудлын учигийг олж байгаа тэр хавьд тухайн хүний амьдралын утга учир оршиж, үүргээ биелүүлж мөн түүнчлэн хүсэл нь гүйцэж байж болно. Тэхээр үүндээ зарцуулсан оюуны чадамжаа билэг гэж хэлээд байна аа даа? Тэр билэг нээгдсэн хүн гэдэг нь үүнийг л хэлээ болов уу. Билэг оюуны зэрэгцээ хүний нийгмийн эрхэм дээд шаардлага, хэрэгцээ болсон ухамсар гээч зүйл байна. Үүн дээр суурилсан төлөвшил, соёл иргэншил гэх ойлголт байна. Энэ бүхнийг өөртөө цогцлоож амжаад өөрийн асуудлаас давж өрөөл бусдын, нийтийн хэмжээний асуудлыг шийдэлцэх хэмжээнд очвол суутан болох гээд ч байгаа юм уу. Билгийн чанад хязгаар хүрсэн гэдэг нь энэ хавьцаа ойлголт байхаа даа. Өрний ойлголтоор бол билэг оюун боловсорсон бол educated man гэж тодорхойлж байгаа байх. Суу их чадалтаныг genius гээд байгаа байх. Манай "билэг танхай" гэх ойлголт байдаг. Энэ бол угтаа ямар ч системтэй боловсрол үгүй атал дан ганц авьяасаар нүдэх гээд байдаг, заримдаа хадуурдаг буруу зөрүү авдаг нөхдүүд, айн? Түүнийгээ өвөг дээдэс маань билэг танхай гэж "залруулж" байж. Тэхээр билэг танхай гэж байвал "энэ маань ёстой суутан болохоор хүн, даанч жаахан системтэй боловсрол олж билэг нээгдэх л хэрэгтэй байна" гэсэн санааг дагуулаад байх шиг байдаг. Тэхээр билэг танхай гэдэг бол алдар цол биш тухайн хүнд өгч буй тодорхойлолт байж болох нь.

Амбийц гэдэг үгийг тайлбарлах гэж үзье л дээ. Алив хүн өөрийн хийж буй ажил, мэргэжил, бизнесээрээ бахархах, өөртөө эрэмших зүйл байж болно. Ерөөсөө тэр зүйлийг эхлүүлж, эрхэлж байгаа нь түүний дур сонирхол, ажилдаа өгч өгч буй ач холбогдол, утга учиртай ямар нэг байдлаар холбоотой байх ёстой. Үүнийхээ хүрээнд тухайн хүн 1-рт үүгээрээ бахархах, 2-рт үүндээ ач холбогдол өгч магадгүй үүнийг нь бусад хүмүүс дэмжин тэтгээсэй гэсэн сэтгэл хөдлөл байж болно. Үүнийг л амбийц гэж байгаа юм болов уу. Тэхээр бидэнд ийм сэтгэл хөдлөл байдаг ч гэсэн тухайлан нэршсэн зүйл алга. Энэ бол техник технологийн эринтэйгээ хамт бидэнд хүрч ирсэн соёлын шинэ ойлголт болж ирж байна. Компьютерыг ТЭБМ биш компьютер гэж нэрлэж хэвшсэн шигээ үүнийг амбийц гэж нэрлээд явчих нь зүйтэй болов уу. Гэхдээ бид шинэ соёлын ойлголтод мэдрэмтгий бөгөөд туйлширч ханддаг. Тиймээс бид амбийцыг бас л хэтрүүлэн авч үзэх явдал байна. Амбийц өөрийнхөө хэм хэмжээнд байж л сая утга төгөлдөр болж харагдана. Ихдэхээрээ энэ биш болчихож байна. Монгол ойлголтоор бол барилдахаасаа таахалзах, нохойноосоо гинж нь гэх мэтчилэн хэлж болох ойлголт руу шилжчих гэмтэй юм.

https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3887/is-using-a-public-key-for-logging-in-to-ssh-any-better-than-saving-a-password
The use of the session identifier in publickey authentication has an interesting effect not often remarked on: it affords extra protection against a man-in-the-middle attack. If the attacker executes the key exchange separately on each side, the session identifiers (IDs) will be different. The server demands a signature over the ID for its connection with the attacker -- but the client will only produce a signature over the ID on its side. The attacker has no way to force them to be the same, and no way to induce the client to do anything else. A challenge-response protocol would not do this.
challenge-response model

I fear that some readers will miss the implications of “long and random passwords”. A private key carries a lot more entropy than a realistic password (let's say at least 128 bits of entropy, assuming a decent RNG; a 10-ASCII-character password has about half that, a lot less if it's memorable). Also people reuse passwords a lot more often than private keys. So in practice there are security advantages to a private key. – Gilles May 17 '11 at 16:59
@Gilles asymmetric keys like those used in SSH all have at least 1024 bits of entropy, not 128. However asymmetric encryption also requires more entropy. 1024 bit asymmetric is weaker than 128 bit symmetric encryption. When somebody tries to brute force an SSH server, they have to do it "slowly" to avoid creating a denial of service attack. This means a password with ~50 bits of entropy will take hundreds of millions of years to guess. Go any faster and the server will be blown off the internet for the duration of the attack, and the sysadmin is going to notice/investigate. – Abhi Beckert Feb 21 '16 at 6:48 
To effectively brute force a 10 character password you need hundreds of trillions of guesses per second, and it'll still take weeks. No server is capable of receiving anything remotely close to that many SSH login attempts. A few hundred attempts per second is more realistic, which is too slow to be effective unless the password is terrible. Anybody reading this website is smart enough to choose a good password. – Abhi Beckert Feb 21 '16 at 6:50 

@AbhiBeckert I think you're confusing key size with entropy. Also, breaking the key or password isn't always have to be an online attack: the attacker may have access to the public key. In any case I think you missed my point altogether: the entropy in a key pair, barring bugs, is always far larger than any memorable passwords. – Gilles Feb 21 '16 at 13:09

Apple Mac компьютер дээр Монгол крилл үсгээр 
яаж бичих вэ (Copy Paste хийх боломжтой)
Сайн уу Андууд аа,

Өнөөдрийг хүртэл Apple компани MAC компьютерийн үйлдлийн системдээ Монгол Крилл үсгээр бичих боломжийг олгоогүй л байна. (Интернэтэд хэд хэдэн Монгол гарын программ байгаа боловч Таслах-Хуулах-Буулгах боломжгүй (Copy-Paste), өдөр тутам ашиглахад хүндрэлтэй байдаг)

Ингээд Монголоор бичиж байхдаа Copy-Paste хийх боломжтой гарын программыг цоо шинээр бичихээр шийдсэн юм.

Та бүхэн доорхи хаягаар орж файлыг татаж аваарай.

Суулгах заавар хуучнаараа:

1. Татаж авсан файлыг нээхэд дотор нь 2ш файл байгаа.
2. Дээрхи 2 файлыг /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ хавтсанд хуулж тавина.
(Энэ хавтсыг нээхдээ Finder -аа нээж байгаад "Command+Shift+G" дараад /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ гэж бичнэ)
(Updated 2015.12.2: Нөхөд өө, энэ хавтас бровс хийж гарч ирэхгуй шүү, системийн нуусан хавтас юм. Зааврын дагуу яг бичвэл нээгдэнэ.)
3. Дараа нь System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources цонхыг нээгээд доор байгаа + товч дарна
4. Дээрээс хоёрт байгаа "Others" -ийг дараад "Mongolian"-ийг сонгоорой.

Суулгаад Mongolian-ийг сонгосны дараа хэрэв крилл байтугай юу ч үсэг гарахгүй бол түр хүлээгээд үзээрэй, 1-2 мин.

Санал сэтгэгдэл байвал Коммент үлдээгээрэй ( bmr333@gmail.com )

Isomorphic JavaScript Web Development by Tomas Alabes 
English | 2017 | ISBN: 1785889769 | 226 Pages | True PDF, EPUB, AZW3 | 16 MB

Universal JavaScript with React and Node
Leverage the power of React and Node to build complete web applications in pure JavaScript
The latest trend in web development, Isomorphic JavaScript, allows developers to overcome some of the shortcomings of single-page applications by running the same code on the server as well as on the client. Leading this trend is React, which, when coupled with Node, allows developers to build JavaScript apps that are much faster and more SEO-friendly than single-page applications.
This book begins by showing you how to develop frontend components in React. It will then show you how to bind these components to back-end web services that leverage the power of Node. You'll see how web services can be used with React code to offload and maintain the application logic. By the end of this book, you will be able to save a significant amount of development time by learning to combine React and Node to code fast, scalable apps in pure JavaScript.
What You Will Learn

Build on the client side with the awesomeness of React
Style your application effectively
Render the server side using React
Implement a GraphQL server based on Node, Express, and SQL
Fetch application data using Relay
Build an isomorphic router to use in the application
Deploy your application to a cloud host
Secure your application with a solid token-based authentication system

To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

Filter is used to SKIP unwanted items, and might return with less items or even NO items.
Map modifies the items, and will always return the same amount of items.
>filter returns ONLY the items that meet the criteria you specify in the callback. It's sort of like .map + an if statement.

Netfilter is a framework provided by Linux that allows various networking-related operations to be implemented in the form of customized handlers. Netfilter offers various functions and operations for packet filtering, network address translation, and port translation, which provide the functionality required for directing packets through a network, as well as for providing ability to prohibit packets from reaching sensitive locations within a computer network.

Netfilter represents a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel, allowing specific kernel modules to register callback functions with the kernel's networking stack. Those functions, usually applied to the traffic in the form of filtering and modification rules, are called for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the networking stack.

What chemical elements do human bodies comprise of?
Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Only about 0.85% is composed of another five elements: potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium. All 11 are necessary for life. The remaining elements are trace elements, of which more than a dozen are thought on the basis of good evidence to be necessary for life. All of the mass of the trace elements put together (less than 10 grams for a human body) do not add up to the body mass of magnesium, the least common of the 11 non-trace elements.

Python Machine Learning Cookbook: Practical solutions from preprocessing to deep learning by Chris Albon 
English | 2018 | ISBN: 1491989388 | 336 Pages | EPUB | 10 MB

This practical guide provides nearly 200 self-contained recipes to help you solve machine learning challenges you may encounter in your daily work. If you’re comfortable with Python and its libraries, including pandas and scikit-learn, you’ll be able to address specific problems such as loading data, handling text or numerical data, model selection, and dimensionality reduction and many other topics.
Each recipe includes code that you can copy and paste into a toy dataset to ensure that it actually works. From there, you can insert, combine, or adapt the code to help construct your application. Recipes also include a discussion that explains the solution and provides meaningful context. This cookbook takes you beyond theory and concepts by providing the nuts and bolts you need to construct working machine learning applications.
You’ll find recipes for:

Vectors, matrices, and arrays
Handling numerical and categorical data, text, images, and dates and times
Dimensionality reduction using feature extraction or feature selection
Model evaluation and selection
Linear and logical regression, trees and forests, and k-nearest neighbors
Support vector machines (SVM), naïve Bayes, clustering, and neural networks
Saving and loading trained models

Jordan Peterson is asked the question how should one take notes from books and lectures. 
1) don't write notes while the lecture is taking place. so, you can practice the ability to retain and recall information.
2) when reading books don't highlight or underline. read a bit of the material. then, write down what you are thinking or what you remember in the context of what you are thinking about.
Jordan Peterson explains how he is able to extemporaneously come out with his subject matter during a lecture
When he reads he marks interesting ideas mentally then figures out how they relate to all the other ideas he knows. 
do I believe it?
how might I criticize it?
It is this method that enables you recall information because you make it apart of yourself.
So, separate the actions of reading and note taking.
Read, write, Think or Read, Think, and reformulate the sentence.

Dealing with line endings and Git's autocrlf
If autogen.sh produces output like the following:

./autogen.sh: line 1: $':\r': command not found
' '--srcdir=/home/user/libreoffice' '--enable-option-checking=fatal'
configure: WARNING: you should use --build, --host, --target
configure: WARNING: invalid host type: 
********************************************************************

*
********************************************************************

' not recognizedystem type... Invalid configuration `
 failedre: error: /bin/bash ./config.sub 
Error running configure at ./autogen.sh line 241.
... then you probably have line ending problems. This might occur if you mistakenly set Git's core.autocrlf=true.

To fix the issue, run these commands (WARNING: uncommitted changes will be lost!):

git config --unset core.autocrlf
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard
git clean -x -f
./autogen.sh

https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/136821/unit-test-fails-while-building-libreoffice/?answer=151690#post-id-151690
Hello, my first time build/make of Libreoffice clone from official repo failed with 2 errors: "Run: 88   Failure total: 2   Failures: 2   Errors: 0", I didn't use "build-nocheck", I found other person was suggested to build with "build-nocheck" option.
But https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/GenericBuildingHints#Build_system_internals says:"make performs a number of checks (e.g. unit tests). That is a subset make check tests. There is a build-nocheck switch that disables the checks when building. It may speed up the build considerably. However, it should definitely not be used when building for the first time, because otherwise you may miss a problem with your setup that will give you a build with strange behavior that nobody else sees."
I can't build/make with no errors on MacBook Pro2011/macOS 10.13.4 with latest Xcode and its commandline tools.
Commands I used was:"${LODE_HOME}/opt/bin/make clean && ${LODE_HOME}/opt/bin/make -s ENABLE_SYMBOLS=true 2>&1"
