I must lose myself in action, lest I wither in despair.

Man's Search for Meaning:
Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning.
The truth- that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and believe have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love.
Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now.

Live Sales Calls And How To Handle Fear On The Phone.

Any psychiatrist will tell you that work-keeping busy- is one of the best anesthetics ever known for sick nerves. Henry W. Longfellow found that out for himself when he lost his young wife. His wife had been melting some sealing-wax at a candle one day, when her clothes caught on fire. Longfellow heard her cries and tried to reach her in time; but she died from the burns. For a while, Longfellow was so tortured by the memory of that dreadful experience that he nearly went insane; but, fortunately for him, his three small children needed his attention. In spite of his own grief, Longfellow undertook to be father and mother to his children. He took them for walks, told them stories, played games with them, and immortalised their companionship in his poem The Children's Hour. He also translated Dante; and all these duties combined kept him so busy that he forgot himself entirely, and regained his peace of mind. As Tennyson declared when he lost his most intimate friend, Arthur Hallam: "I must lose myself in action, lest I wither in despair." Most of us have little trouble "losing ourselves in action" while we have our noses to the grindstone and are doing our day's work. But the hours after work-they are the dangerous ones. Just when we're free to enjoy our own leisure, and ought to be happiest-that's when the blue devils of worry attack us. That's when we begin to wonder whether we're getting anywhere in life; whether we're in a rut; whether the boss "meant anything" by that remark he made today.

I did it so that I would have no time for sorrow and worry.

“How To Stop Worrying And Start Living” By Dale Carnegie
In the spring of 1871, a young man picked up a book and read twenty-one words that had a profound effect on his future. His name was Sir William Osier. Here are the twenty-one words that he read in the spring of 1871-twenty-one words from Thomas Carlyle that helped him lead a life free from worry: "Our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand." Did Dr. Osier mean to say that we should not make any effort to prepare for tomorrow? No. Not at all. But he did go on in that address to say that the best possible way to prepare for tomorrow is to concentrate with all your intelligence, all your enthusiasm, on doing today's work superbly today. That is the only possible way you can prepare for the future. 

The longer you hang in there, the greater the chance that something will happen in your favor. No matter how hard it seems, the longer you persist, the more likely your success.

Couldn't agree with #5 more (make sacrifices now for dividends later).  I clearly remember making that decision at 21 - cutting back on expenses, saving money and saying no to drinking out, frivolous trips, and most importantly, not playing the game of trying to keep up with my friends as they bought new cars, homes and toys.
Fast forward less than a decade later and my net worth is several times more than my close friends and I've "retired" from working.  They're still working 9-to-5, albeit high paying jobs and trying to pay off debt and are "stuck" in their lifestyles. 
Because of sacrifices made in my early 20s, I became financially free in my late 20s.  Dividends in life add up quickly.  But the costs of indulging early in life can equally compound.

Different types of capital that make up a balanced life: Personal capital, emotional capital, social capital and financial capital. 
Cut your losses: A lot of times, it's darkest right before you crash into the wall.
Make the best of each day while steadily maintaining a solid trajectory towards your future goals. Keep a 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 year vision on your GPS.
Love the message!  Keep up the great work!

These videos are mostly trite and obvious things that any sensible adult should know. And it is given in such a mentor-on-high stance it becomes nearly insulting. Yet I love them. Because whenever I get annoyed at the repetitiveness and the rhetorical questions used over and over and over again, I always remind myself of the meta-context for this series: a father leaving a legacy of life lessons for his son to pick up one day and take in.
And suddenly all the annoying qualities become endearing and all is forgiven. Keep up the good work - wish someone had taught me these when I was going through my 20s.

When you're examining the bridge's planks for defects, you might decide it is much more rational to turn back. Only your goal will carry you to the other side.
Don't linger and undercut what you've done.

Set Clear And Safe Boundaries For Yourself:
This will make coping much easier. Social decorum dictates that most intimacy doesn’t occur in the presence of others. Design strategies that remove direct and private contact with the person. Whenever possible interact with the person only when there are other people around. This will prevent intimacy and with luck the workplace crush will fade.
Improve Your Home Life And/Or Add Extracurricular Activities:
So many of us get absolutely absorbed in work. It is our lives. When this is the case it is perfectly natural to look for affection and intimacy at work. Make yourself and your social life outside of work a priority. Once other people enter your life, the attraction for that colleague often disappears.

Reasons Why You Need To Engage In Office Politics:
You start a new job. You’re getting to know your co-workers, sizing them up, learning everyone’s roles and positions at the company. You’re figuring out who you jive with, who you may butt heads with, who the office clown is. But then it happens: A co-worker makes a comment to you, outside the presence of other employees, about one of your co-workers.
They’re waiting to see how you respond. Do you know how to handle yourself in this type of situation? You should probably have a plan, because chances are, it’s something you’ll encounter at some point—or, more likely, often—during your career. According to a recent study, 80% of people surveyed said they experience office politics, and gossip is the most common form.
And the real kicker? Most respondents said that participating in office politics is necessary to advance your career.
You want your colleagues to like you, so you don’t want to leave them hanging when they initiate the gossip, but you also don’t want to get involved in the drama that will likely ensue if you disparage a fellow employee. And gossip isn’t the only form of office politics to worry about—there’s the colleague who takes credit for everyone else’s work, the one who sabotages everyone else to get ahead, and the fake who uses incessant flattery to manipulate their colleagues.
This is a lot to deal with, but there’s no need to fret.
There are ways to get involved with office politics in a way that won’t tarnish your professional reputation and can even benefit your career.
First off, make sure to always keep your radar on so that you detect the presence of negative office politics that may affect you early on and handle the situation before it’s too late. Is there a colleague who always disagrees with you or openly demeans you? Are you being left off of important correspondence or out of meetings? Watch out for the red flags—awareness is everything.
...
When dealing with an office gossip, always exercise tact.
If your co-worker persists with the gossip, try to stay as diplomatic as possible, or attempt to politely end the conversation. One best practice here is to think about how you’re going to handle it in advance—what will you say?
My recommendation? Saying “I’m so sorry you feel that way.” And then silence. When you respond empathetically, but without engaging, you’ve officially made yourself boring to gossip to. And that is ideal.
If you’re dealing with more obvious, aggressive office politics, like an individual who is sabotaging you for their own benefit, you might need to take a more direct approach. Document your exchanges with this individual, and speak to them first (always). Prepare to approach the person in a non-personal, curious manner, saying something like: “Hey, can we talk for a moment? I noticed you did X, and I just wanted to see where you were coming from. For me, it appeared almost as if you were Y, but I know that’s not your character. Is this just a misinterpretation on my end?” By giving the person the benefit of the doubt, and bringing it to their attention, you’ve stood your ground without attacking their character. Avoid personal attacks at all costs, and if the circumstances continue to escalate, reaching out to a manager or member of HR might be necessary.
On the flip side, make sure to proactively participate in positive office politics. Ask a superior to counsel or mentor you so that you have a trusted ally if an issue arises.
Getting sucked into the negative office politics is a slippery slope that can have a major impact on your career, both short and long term. And remember: disengaging from all office politics is not the answer. As Buddha says: “Rule your mind, or it will rule you.” Those who excel in the workforce understand that they must effectively participate in the good, the bad and the ugly... And that means learning how to master office politics—when to empathize and remain neutral, when to stand up for yourself, and when to leverage the joys of positive politics.

Keep Your Eyes on the Goal
Remind yourself, as many times as it takes, that you’re not engaging in office politics for fun or to be one of “them;” you’re doing it for two reasons: career success and job fulfillment. When you get caught up emotionally, you run the risk of making decisions you’ll regret down the road. Gossiping, backstabbing, manipulating, and the rest are not needed to win at office politics. Keeping your eyes on the goal lets you develop and maintain a strategic approach for dealing with your workplace’s unique political atmosphere.
Navigating office politics works best when you follow the golden rule of negotiating: end with everybody feeling like they won.
Never Pit Rivals Against One Another:
One situation that everybody dreads is getting caught between two warring parties. In a situation like that, it’s easy to tell each of them what they want to hear, even if that’s just nodding in agreement when they bad-mouth each other. But fake allegiances are always exposed in the long run, and then, neither of the people you were trying to impress will trust you again. Instead, steer your conversations back to the facts: What decisions need to be made? What are the next steps? What can I do to help improve this situation?
It’s a lot better to be a competent, conscious player than to be a bystander or a pawn in the game.
The key is to understand the players and the rules and then to play the game in a way that aligns with your personal values and principles. Don’t be fooled into compromising “just this once,” because once is all it takes to lose control.

Every time you instantiate a class, you decide where it shall live; on the stack or on the heap. This has an impact on the lifetime of the object. Stack allocated objects are destroyed when their scope is exited (i.e. when a function returns), however, heap allocated objects do not have lifetimes associated with scope and must be cleaned up manually (or by using RAII).

There is a lot of compiler magic that can cause issues when you aren't aware of what the compiler is doing. There is a good reason it does it, but it can be hard to find information on it that makes sense to a beginner.

Graph algorithms with C++ 
Graph theory hold corner stone of modern computer science, extending its tentacles to social networks to neural networks to finding paths in maps. In this course we are looking at graph theory by computer science prospective. We are going to start our discussion by looking at the basic terms of graph theory and them jump on to discuss graph theory related algorithms and then implement those with c++. Following are the types of algorithms we are going to discuss in this course.
Graph traversing.
Topological sorting and strongly connected component associated algorithms
Shortest paths.
Finding minimum spanning trees.
Maximum flow.
NP complete algorithms such as graph coloring, traveling salesman problem etc.

`ComPtr() throw() : ptr_(nullptr) { }`
What does throw() do in this context?
>without a list of potential exception types, it's the pre-c++11 equivalent of `noexcept` http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/except_spec

With a function prototype like this: `foo(AType *&OutParam);`, what exactly is `*&` mean?
>a pointer passed by ref
>Reference to a pointer to AType (edited)
>`AType *outParam` would be passing a pointer by value (copied), `AType *&outParam` would be passing a reference to it, so you can modify the value in the caller
>hm, so if I pass `AType *outParam`, i get a copy of that pointer in my function.  So if I pass in `AType *arg`, the function creates a local copy called `outParam`.  So `arg`->address123 and `outParam`->address123.
but `arg` and `outParam` are two separate pointers stored in different areas of memory
vs if I pass the pointer by reference
`arg` and `outParam` reference the same pointer in the memory location where `arg` is stored?

>in both cases `arg->var` will point to the same `var` instance

```void ptr(AType *p) { 
    p->val = 34;
    p = 0;
}

void ref(AType *&r) {
    r->val = 42;
    r = 0;
}

void caller() {
    AType *t = new AType;

    ptr(t); // t->val is now 32, t is still what it used to be

    ref(t); // t->val is now 42, but t is now 0
}```

>got it, that makes sense
I guess, that's like the double pointer convention in C

>yeah, a ref is just a pointer you can’t change, with cleaner syntax (edited)

>Thinking of references as "alternate name for" is easier than "self-dereferencing pointer that is const" unless you've known pointers for years before you heard of references.

copy elision
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_elision

https://www.quora.com/Why-is-C++-so-much-harder-to-learn-than-either-C-or-C
C++ is a complex, permissive language designed for full control over the machine. It allows absolute control of the data in memory (storage classes). This requires some rather refined techniques for non-trivial types (see rvalue references and copy elision rules). Rather than trying to work around logical errors by dynamic checks, it assumes that the programmer is proficient enough not to do them and when they do, the process simply crashes. That’s the price for code efficiency; the idea is that the code must be correct to be acceptable anyway, so (implicit) dynamic checks are redundant. And C++ is a language for people who try to get rid of everything that’s redundant while providing support for everything that’s technically possible. But for that, you need full control, so the language contains more means of control. That makes it complex and therefore harder to learn.

I would like to stress this point as well, building anything vaguely complex with C++ and learning more in-depth about some features of the language can really help you expand your understanding of the current programming environment in general.
Will understanding shared memory, native threading, memory ordering, optimizing, working with "fundamental" algorithms (e.g. stuff like partition and sort rather than stuff like map, filter, reduce), zero-cost abstraction, handling computations using simd... etc, help you in most projects ? No, not even in most C++ projects.
But knowing that you can always mess with the source code of your database or library, knowing you can always write a heavily optimize version of your software or plugin a custom C++ library for certain tasks, understanding threading and memory tit for tat is "empowering". It makes you code without the fear of the unknown, it gives you a "safe" area where most projects lie, since you know you've done harder stuff (in terms of programming) and you know that, no matter how much hidden complexity this project hides, you can likely handle it.
Not to mention that, on the occasions where your skills come in handy you will basically be heralded as a wizard hero by colleagues who only ever learned scripting languages.
C++ is the only language ,that I don't use at work, which I make sure I always stay somewhat up to date with, be it poking around the std, reading a bit on the new compiler patches or watching talks and reading books, blogs (or reddit posts). I personally would say this has helped me tremendously, but in the end that is a personal opinion and the same argument could be made about Rust or C.

C++ is also a great language for building a lower level understanding of computers since it operates very close to the metal and concepts like cache locality start to become more relevant. Knowing how a system works under the hood will probably help you write better code in other languages too.

.aat -> Apple Advanced Typography
AAT font features do not alter the underlying typed text; they only affect the characters' representation during glyph conversion.

Developed jointly by Adobe and Microsoft, OpenType (.otf, .ttf, .ttc) fonts improves upon Microsoft's TrueType fonts, by incorporating a greater extension of the basic character set, adding a more robust data structure for prescribing better typographic behavior. This includes small capitalization, old-style numerals, and more detailed shapes, such as glyphs and ligatures. OpenType fonts are single files that can also be scaled to any size, are clear and readable in all sizes, and can be used on both Macintosh and Windows platforms without conversion. Designers will benefit from OpenType over previous formats due to the much larger character set and for the programs that support it: automatic alternative character and ligature support.

The symbol, which I can never find on Microsoft Word's symbol list, is a hollow square with a single, vertical line through the middle. It's placed at the end of a number, such as 2,550[I] but imagine the box/line as intersecting and the top/bottom of the vertical line extending outside the box at both top and bottom. (I had to play with brackets, here) and either the same size font of the numbers or smaller, but never larger (not meant to overshadow the numbers). It's very common in the construction and architecture industry- especially when handwriting instructions or notes in order to avoid having to 'read' someone's handwriting (plus, it takes up slightly less space). For whatever reason, it's not available in most font/symbol options.

If you intend to place a wifi adapter in Monitor mode, you have got to have a primary network/Internet connection, either an ethernet adapter or another Wifi stick for both Internet access and not losing remote control of the VM/raspberry.

Tips to Understand Legacy Code:
Decoupling: a simple and efficient way to work on decoupling code is to write unit test on a specific piece of code.
In a large monolithic / legacy code base, you typically struggle to just compile and link with a specific piece of code without pulling a lot of other code (singletons to initialize, cyclic dependencies, poor organization in different modules...). Therefore you are forced to cut / invert the dependencies and reorganize the code to be able to unit test just this specific module (without having to build & link with the entire app).
And the good thing about it is that, at the same time, you are also introducing unit testing on the legacy code which will help a lot to refactor it (some people define legacy code as untested code).

Reset a root password on Fedora, CentOS, and similar Linux distros:
@vmlinuz line, remove rhgb quiet and replace with the following:
rd.break enforcing=0

Setting enforcing=0 will allow you to avoid performing a complete system SELinux relabeling. Once the system is rebooted, you'll only have to restore the correct SELinux context for the /etc/shadow file. I'll show you how to do this too.
Press Ctrl-x to start.
The system will now be in emergency mode.
Remount the hard drive with read-write access:
# mount –o remount,rw /sysroot
Run chroot to access the system:

# chroot /sysroot
You can now change the root password:
# passwd
Type the new root password twice when prompted. If you are successful, you should see a message that reads "all authentication tokens updated successfully."
Type exit twice to reboot the system.
Log in as root and restore the SELinux label to the /etc/shadow file.
# restorecon -v /etc/shadow
Turn SELinux back to enforcing mode:
# setenforce 1

Provide the detail information of SCP process using -v parameter: scp -v

Provide modification times, access times, and modes from original files: The “-p” parameter will help you on this. An estimated time and the connection speed will appear on the screen.

Make file transfer faster using -C parameter
One of parameter that can faster your file transfer is “-C” parameter. The “-C” parameter will compress your files on the go. The unique thing is the compression is only happen in the network. When the file is arrived to the destination server, it will returning into the original size as before the compression happen.
The thing that we should notice that compression method will not work on any files. When the source file is already compressed, you will not find any improvement there. Files such as .zip, .rar, pictures, and .iso files will not affected by “-C” parameter.

Specify specific port to use with SCP
Usually SCP is using port 22 as a default port. But for security reason, you may change the port into another port. For example, we are using port 2249. Then the command should be like this.
scp -P 2249

Copy files inside directory recursively: scp -r

Kyu Tee Lee 4 days ago (edited)
I am 53 years of age.
I came from a highly disfunctional broken home family. 
I at age 10 and older raised myself.
I did not go to school after graduating highschool.
I fought against the general mindset of the world that a disability made one inept. 
I have proven time and again that I can do more than be a housewife, even though my parents were of the mindset that being a housewife was all I should or could be able to do. 
I have educated myself in: Commercial and Residential Air conditioning and Refrigeration and gained certification, Cerification requirements and obtained a 10 ton pilot certification for a seafaring vessel,went through internships for home repair and restoration and eventually became a contractor and much more. I have in the past 6 years taught myself graphic arts, create 3D meshes, edit videos, create textures and some coding. 
To me the ability to learn something new is a great joy and not a chore.
I believe those that do not learn something new everyday are basically like the walking dead.

Failure is not a depressive issue for me, nor is it the end of the line as most seem to believe. 
It is a wakeup call to me and signals that I lack some knowledge and need to educate myself further before trying again. I am not perfect but I am learning and growing to gain more perfection without dwelling on failure. I know there are others with more knowledge than I have obtained. So being humble is a good asset when wanting to learn from someone with more knowledge and in teaching others in what knowledge you have obtained.
I do not blame my parents or other for my life!
If my life was different I might not have struggled to prove I was capable of so much more in life.
Those that make excuses for their lot in life are wasting the time and energy to make a better life for themselves. 
It takes RESPONSIBILITY, EDUCATION, HARD WORK, INTEGRITY AND FORTITUDE!
Beware: those that do not motivate and encourage you in your goals or dreams are not the people you want in your life!!! Life is not an easy experience and life is the biggest classroom you will ever be in.

Sorry about being so long-winded(/ˌlɒŋˈwɪndɪd/). I mostly wanted to put this up (t)here in case someone else is in a similar situation because; life is hard. A family member is currently on a psychiatric hold; I was the victim of a domestic violence situation last week; I lost my insurance the same month I got promoted so have been paying out-of-pocket for my medications. Etc. It never ends, no one's life is easy, and nothing is for free. Spend the time, money and energy on your MENTAL HEALTH first and foremost, so that you can help those around you to the best of your ability, and hope they do the same for themselves so that everyone who knows you is better off because you're around.

As a “sin of omission,” ostracism is an act that someone didn’t do: they didn’t acknowledge you or reach out to you or invite you to something. Whether the act of one person or many, it can include being left off email threads, being looked over for a committee position, or being ignored when making suggestions. You may experience conversations stopping when you try to join in, no one taking your order for a coffee run, or finding out that you haven’t been invited to a weekend outing with colleagues.

With upbringing like mine, how else could I turn out?

Find New Sources of Income: With the birth of The IRA, there simply is no such thing as job security anymore. If you are dependent on a job (“just over broke”) for 100% of your income, you are in a very bad position.  There are thousands of different ways to make extra money. What you don’t want to do is to have all of your eggs in one basket. One day when the economy melts down and you are out of a job are you going to be destitute or are you going to be okay?

Either of the following would be equally correct:
I climbed the stairs. (Not "I climbed up the stairs.")
OR
I walked up the stairs.

if I were talking about our own stairs at home, which I use every day, I think I would say I walked up the stairs, or I went upstairs. However if I visited a tall building and the lifts (elevators) were not working, I might say I had to climb the stairs to the eighteenth floor. If I had to go into my loft (attic) at home I would probably say I climbed up the loft ladder. Our speech is highly nuanced but it is not always easy to spot the rules which we all employ, without thinking, every day.

carve and engrave:
Engrave is usually writing (letters and numbers)--and is usually on wood or metal. It means to cut deeply into. It can also be used figuratively. Engraving is the art of 'carving' letters, numbers, words or designs into hard surfaces including metal, stone or glass. Humans have made their marks for a very long time and today there are more options than ever before. Marking keepsakes with permanent messages and symbols is a beautiful way to tell the story of the people, places and events you are connected to. Engraving is like writing a love letter that will last for ever. There are four main ways to engrave or mark jewellery these days and each method shares similarities to precious letters written with love.
Carve is cruder and more general. You can carve up a turkey (cut it into pieces). If you carve your name into something, it is usually a large something (He carved his name on the tree). Also, carve would include simple shapes (He carved a big heart in the top of the desk).

I don’t hold a grudge on C++.
If you tend to hold a grudge, you don't let it go when you feel someone's insulted or wronged you. I hope you won't hold a grudge against me for bringing it up.
Grudge comes from the now dead Middle English word "grutch," which meant "to complain or grumble." Someone who bears a grudge might often be grouchy. You can specify a type of grudge: political grudge, personal grudge, etc. You know Grandpa's been holding a grudge against the neighbors for years, but you have to wonder: How long can he hold that shotgun?

The first thing I did was clean the bathroom. Actually. I’ll be honest and tell you my mother in law cleaned the bathroom. The tub was moldy, the toilet was totally disgusting, and the brick floors (yes, brick!) were pretty gross. If you don’t feel like you can get clean somewhere, then you’ll never feel any relief from the gross. She scrubby bubbled everything (even the floor!!!).

Excuse me, hang on a second, I'll be with you in a second.
Would you mind if I make a call, would it disturb you?

palate:
1 : the roof of the mouth separating the mouth from the nasal cavity — see hard palate, soft palate
2 a : a usually intellectual taste or liking: too ornate for my palate
… I heard a little too much preaching … and lost my palate for it. —George Eliot
b : the sense of taste: serves Korean food adapted for the American palate.

How best to...

Toothpaste. Are you a top, middle or bottom squeezer?

You can breathe through your nose and have all of those problems, though. It's having your tongue slathered onto your palate that would have made the difference. You can breathe through your nose but still have your tongue sitting at the bottom of your mouth, which would still cause malocclusion and improper growth of the maxilla and mandibles.

That would seem to be at the heart of a lot of cranio facial problems.  Nasal obstruction is not normal and should be addressed ASAP.

You mean the posterior third of the tongue? Try and say the word "wing", but holding the "NG" sound, that will get your tongue up there.
if you imagine getting the back of your tongue up as far posteriorly as your uvula you should hit the spot. I thought i had my posterior third up but i didnt realize how far posterior it needed to be. Huge difference now.

Do NOT push it against teeth. Just palate. Pushing it against the teeth will push your teeth forward and might create an overbite or other nasty side effects.

I just turned 20 two days ago. I have a severe underbite (like, my lower jaw isn't just pushed back, it's caved in when I bite down). I have been doing tongue posture for a few months now to the point that second nature, and I see positive changes like cheekbones growing. But my lower jaw is awfully narrow (my upper jaw was expanded years ago when I had braces) and still juts out. Do you think that this is because I don't bite down? What should I do?

https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/452764/correct-prepositions-to-use-with-treat-and-hold
A: Do you cook yourself? What did you cook last?
B: I made salad, it's tasty, I will treat you to it later. ("I'll treat you to some of it later" sounds more natural.)
A: I will hold you to that.
When someone says “I’ll hold you to that” they are implying they are going to take what you said seriously. In this case, the person is saying they do want some of the salad you prepared.
Edit: It’s less of the person saying “I really have to eat that now” and more of the person expecting your offer to be true. A lot of times we offer things out of generosity but the other person may not accept, so by saying “I’ll hold you to that” they are stating that they would like to accept what you offered.

I'm coming into town, what have you been up to?

I'm also a very quiet person, so my approach is a little different. I stay in the background of a small group of friends and maybe interject a few small words here and there, then once someone else starts a conversation I can piggy back on it. The nice part about being quiet is that people are usually pleasantly surprised when I speak. The downside is that people with short attention spans write me off as boring as soon as we meet and some people never hear me at all because they don't expect me to have anything to say.

How to Invest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSmEJt2xMaI
Small error at 9:46, $150 a month translates into $1,800 more per year not "per month" :) And $150 more rental per month would pay off the $2,400 in furniture in 1 year 4 months not "a year 3 months". I know, proves I was paying attention though :)
The lesson of investing is to choose "profit" over "pretty". That's why when people buy investment properties to rent out they do very little in upgrading the property except painting or other aesthetic changes that invest very little money into the property. Retired people who invested in viable real estate, mutual funds, RSPs, 401k, and GICs throughout their lives are living off of their investments when they retire. (and in Canada, money invested in a RSP reduces your taxable income by the amount that you invested in that year, even better).

I believe the reason that people are distrustful of people who are not drinking with them is because they are violated a ritual, or social norm. It is a slight infraction, but the when someone violates expected behavior, we immediately become suspicious of them, because they may violate other expected behaviors. This makes said person a threat, because their next action is unknown, and the unknown is dangerous. People who conform to norms are predictable, which is useful if you do not want to draw negative attention, such as in the conditions you described.

IRA:individual retirement account
maxing out the 401(k) match
money market fund option
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LSdx2DVSw4
401ks are nice, but we're forgetting something here. Most people change careers every 7 years, and most people quit shit jobs in under 3 years. In this "gig" economy, how can anyone save but on a piecemeal basis?
>you can rollover your 401k money to an 'rollover IRA' if you leave your employer. Simple paperwork. And with the IRA, you can invest in 'basically' anything.
Can you diversify your 401K portfolio?
>Bonds, stocks (domestic, international), MM funds. Seems reasonable to me.

At my last 2 employers they pulled the money market fund option. I think the banksters are trying to keep people out of cash. I've been maxing out the 401(k) match whenever I can and putting it all into the S&P500 index fund option. At worst there will be a 50% drawdown in the market and I will not have lost any money. The 401K rollover has been really beneficial and allowed me to build up a substantial IRA in only a few years.
>I would SERIOUSLY complain to the HR Dept/401k Admin of your employer in that case. Total garbage! ALL 401ks plans 'should' have an MMF option.
>I did complain and all the HR lady told me was "That's just what our 401K provider offers..."
>In that case, IF you want a 'conservative, safe' (relatively) speaking investment I would find a 'short-term bond' fund. This is probably the best choice however NOT as safe as an MMF. BTW, HR people are (many times) fking morons. If necessary, call the 401k Admin and ask 'what's the SAFEST option for me to choose from' if you're concerned about the stock market.

4400 in taxes would be saved by maxing contribution.  I only pay what the company matches right now.  This seems a no brainer to me.
>It is for ANYONE. At the very LEAST, put in enough for your 'company match' if they have one. This is FREE, guaranteed money (company match AND tax savings).

You need the right 401k.... Better off investing in a Roth IRA... Right now where you put your money is going to be more important.  Stock index fund will return way more thanks to the managers... So you saved 2k to give all your money to a stock market... Sorry this isn't that wise.
>Why not the guaranteed 'company match' (if you have one) AND the 'lower tax rates in the 401K'? Further, you CAN invest both your 401k AND a rIRA. I did.

tachometer (revolution-counter, tach, rev-counter, RPM gauge) is an instrument measuring the rotation speed of a shaft or disk, as in a motor or other machine.[1] The device usually displays the revolutions per minute (RPM) on a calibrated analogue dial, but digital displays are increasingly common. The word comes from Greek ταχος (tachos "speed") and metron ("measure"). Essentially the words tachometer and speedometer have identical meaning: a device that measures speed. It is by arbitrary convention that in the automotive world one is used for engine and the other for vehicle speed. In formal engineering nomenclature, more precise terms are used to distinguish the two. : тахометр ᠲᠠᠾᠣᠮᠧᠲ᠋ᠷ, эргэлтийн давтамж хэмжүүр ᠡᠷᠭᠢᠯᠲᠡ ᠶᠢᠨ ᠳᠠᠪᠲᠠᠮᠵᠢ ᠬᠡᠮᠵᠢᠭᠦᠷ

The tick, the Asian longhorned tick (or Haemaphysalis longicornis), has the potential to transmit an assortment of nasty diseases to humans, including an emerging virus that kills up to 30 percent of victims. So far, the tick hasn’t been found carrying any diseases in the US. It currently poses the largest threat to livestock, pets, and wild animals; the ticks can attack en masse and drain young animals of blood so quickly that they die—an execution method called exsanguination.

Retractable Razor Blades Knife with Snap Off Blades and Slide Locks.
Steel blade track supports heavy-duty cutting; thumb-slide blade extend/retract with position lock.

An OTF Knife, also known as an out-the-front knife, sliding knife, or telescoping knife, is a pocketknife with a blade that opens and closes through a hole in one end of the handle. Contrast this with the majority of knives, which are either standard folding knives or are "fixed blade" sheath knives (having no mechanical operation).
"OTF" only refers to the basic portion of the knife's mechanical operation where the blade slides parallel with the handle to deploy.
OTF knives may be further subdivided into manual sliding knives, which are not restricted as inertia knives, and automatic OTF switchblade knives and gravity knives, which are restricted offensive weapons (white weapon).

Overbite is a type of malocclusion that occurs when the lower and upper jaws and/or teeth are not aligned, causing the upper front teeth to cover the lower front teeth. Most often an overbite is hereditary, but it can also be caused by the jaw not forming correctly. Childhood tendencies such as thumb-sucking or prolonged bottle-feeding or pacifier use can cause or worsen an overbite.

Tips and Exercises on Improving Incorrect Swallowing by Prof John Mew
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTN5VDldq2U
Teeth in or near contact, lips closed/sealed. Tongue on the palate. You have to keep trying to keep the tonque on the roof. Dont breaht trough your mouth but inhale and exhale trough your nose. And don't suck with your tonque against the teeth while swallowing but rather let the tonque do a sweep of the food from down to the palatte and swallow with your throat/neck.

Mew Push Swallow by Dr Mike Mew Part 2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKaW3zNIuWY
Learning to rest with the back 1/3 of your tongue onto the roof of your mouth is critical.
1. The back of the tongue is the most critical. Your body is the trunk of the tree. With out it being aligned the results will be mediocre at best. Like a small tree supported by a crutch. ALL MUST WORK IN HARMONY.
2. ?! Tongue should be pulled back when swallowing. When swallow the tongue should do a wave motion like a sweeping motion.

blood melatonin: One recent study indicates that the problem may be due to low melatonin levels. Researchers looked at a group of 60 men with lifelong premature ejaculation problems and 40 men without the condition. The group was divided into three groups and they each had their blood melatonin levels checked. Amazingly, the men with premature ejaculation had levels that were 70% less than the men without the problem.
For four weeks, researchers gave each group an antidepressant drug known to boost melatonin levels. At the end of the four weeks, the men with premature ejaculation had close to normal melatonin levels and their premature ejaculation symptoms had improved.

conscious vs conscience: Both words have to do with the mind, but it's more important to be conscious, or awake, than conscience, or aware of right and wrong. Remain conscious while listening to your friend's moral dilemma so you can use your conscience to give good advice.
Conscience is a noun meaning “sense of the quality of one’s character and conduct,” “adherence to moral principles,” and “consideration of fairness and justice.” Confusion between conscience and conscious occurs because the latter word is sometimes used as a noun synonymous with consciousness, meaning “mental awareness,” though the longer form is usually employed.

hyperthyriodism acclerates heart rate and cause weight-loss, hypothyroidisms slows down your matabolism and causes weight-gain.

Hypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid or low thyroid, is a disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone.[3] It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain.[3] Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre.[3] Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or cretinism.

Brittleness of the nails, meaning that the nails easily become cracked, chipped, split, or peeled, can be observed as a sign of aging or in response to the long-term use of nail polish or exposure to moist conditions (including frequent swimming or dishwashing). Some diseases are also associated with changes in the nails, which can include brittleness. Thin and brittle nails can be a sign of hypothyroidism, for example. The term onychoschizia refers to splitting of the fingernails as well as brittle or soft nails. Taking biotin (a vitamin) supplements can help in some cases of brittle nails, and application of moisturizers after soaking in water can also be of benefit.

put foot down: to refuse very firmly to do or accept something; to use your authority to stop something happening.
"The first time I heard about something" is subject, but the verb is not transitive ("be" is intransitive) so there is no object. What follows "be" is obligatory, and obligatory items are always complements, and hence "when I was around 8 years' old" is a complement. (https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/445930/is-abbreviating-the-object-clause-in-this-sentence-grammatically-correct)
>The verb is "was" and it will not take an object. Whereas, It has the complement (when I was around 8 years old.) You can reduce the complement-clause as: The first time I heard about it was at the age of eight. BTW 8 years old, not 8 years' old.
>A further point about the complement: some people analyse "when" as a subordinator and thus the complement as a subordinate clause. Others follow some modern grammars and take "when" as a preposition, and the complement thus a PP. The latter analysis (which I prefer) can be paraphrased as "at the time when I was around 8 years old".

Fear, uncertainty and doubt (often shortened to FUD) is a disinformation strategy used in sales, marketing, public relations, talk radio, politics, religious organizations, and propaganda. FUD is generally a strategy to influence perception by disseminating negative and dubious or false information and a manifestation of the appeal to fear.

Consumers already use Alipay in 28 countries and that number will rise if Ant Financial succeeds in its current bid to acquire MoneyGram, one of the world’s leading money-transfer companies. 

Down payment (or downpayment, also called a deposit in British English), is a payment used in the context of the purchase of expensive items such as a car and a house, whereby the payment is the initial upfront portion of the total amount due and it is usually given in cash at the time of finalizing the transaction. A loan or the amount in cash is then required to make the full payment.

break [function name]

break [line number] if [condition]
For example,
break 11 if i > 97

place a "watchpoint" which will pause the program if a variable is modified:
watch [variable]

Once our breakpoints are set, we can run the program with the "run" command, or simply:
r [command line arguments if your program takes some]
as most words can be abbreviated in just a letter with gdb.

bt
for backtrack will tell us how we got to that point.

info locals
will display all the local variables and their current values (as you can see I didn't set my d variable to anything so its value is currently garbage).

to list the breakpoints in a program, which can be done by typing info breakpoints
Breakpoints can be deleted by typing delete # where # is the number of the breakpoint gotten from info breakpoints
GDB can also print the backtrace (or bt) at any time, telling you what the current call stack looks like
If you don't want to type out the whole command in gdb, it'll understand shorthand, like r for run or b for breakpoint, d for delete; you can do this for almost all commands in GDB!

p [variable]
will show the value of a particular variable. But even better:

ptype [variable]
shows the type of a local variable. So here we can confirm that d is double type.

set var [variable] = [new value]

step
to run the next line and potentially step into a function. Or just:

next
to just go straight to the line below, ignoring any function call.

delete a breakpoint with:
delete [line number]

Keep running the program from the current breakpoint with:
continue

and exit GDB with:
quit

I used to use the dbx debugger on AIX, and it had a really nice feature that I wish gdb had. There was a ‘call’ command that allowed you to call any function in the app from a breakpoint. I would add functions to my libraries specifically to allow printing out complex data in variables during debugging – and then use another nice dbx feature, macros, to define simple shortcuts to make it all easy. For example, the system in question used a weird binary date format, but the date library had a DisplayFormattedDate(mydate) function, and I set up a dd(x) alias to it to make this even easier. And of course there was more complex binary stuff similarly displayable. Of course, a nice graphical IDE that wrapped dbx might’ve been even nicer, but this call thing was really powerful. It’d be nice if gdb had something similar – and if IDE’s based on gdb gave you a way to access it (I think kdebug has a command window where you could do that).

11:11 Russian Case system.
18:22 Verbs of motion in Russian.
19:18 Aspect of verbs in Russian.
David Emerling 3 years ago (edited)
As for as verbs go, in Russian, it is only through context that many of the nuances of English sentences can be conveyed. 
He works.
He is working.
He worked.
He was working.
He has worked.
He has been working.
He had worked.
He had been working.
He will work
He is going to work.
He will be working.
He will have worked.
He will have been working.
He would work.
He would be working.
He would have worked.
He would have been working.

In Russian, you basically have:
Он работает. (This could mean either "He works" or "He is working")
Он работал.
Он будет работать.
Он работал бы.

As in all languages, there is nothing better than immersion. But, since that is not always possible, one must make the effort to listen, read and speak the language as much as possible. This is where the internet is a great resource!

Russian grammatical rules can be characterized as follows: "The good news is that they have very few exceptions to their rules. The bad news is that they have a bazillion rules."

Getting some formal grammatical education in Russian will vastly accelerate your learning because it will reduce your level of frustration. Without some of this type of formal exposure to their grammatical structure, the language will seem arbitrary.

For instance, the word for "book" in Russian is книга. (pronounced K-NEE-ga). But when you see that word used in various sentences, you can become confused if you do not understand the various cases as described in this excellent video.

Try to find the word for "book" in each of the following sentences, paying close attention to how it is spelled. And, this is just a few examples.

Это очень интересная книга.
This is a very interesting book.

Она читает интересную книгу.
She is reading an interesting book.

Она никогда не читает интересних книг.
She never reads any interesting books.

Мы разговариваем о интересной книге.
We аre discussing an interesting book.

Он всегда ходит в парк со свой любимой книгой.
He always goes to the park with his favorite book.

One thing that has helped my listening comprehension is that I listen to Russian podcasts. There is one, in particular, that has Russian audio books, Радио Фантастики (Radio Fantastica). There is even an app for it, I listen to it with headphones as I walk my dog.

Good luck to anybody trying to learn this language! The points brought out in this video are very good. I have developed a pretty good feel for the grammatical cases and verb aspects but I still hate verbs-of-motion.

Как Ваши успехи в изучении русского на сегодняшний день?

difference between Ш and Щ:
1. Ш - is basically the same as Sh in English. Щ is a sound between Ш and S. I personalty find It is quite similar to Japanese し(shi) which is not exactly shi but more of a mixture between shi and si.

2. These are two different sounds, not "two kinds of sh"! How can someone not hear it? First time they told me this I thought it was a joke. It's like confusing "Iraq" with "Iran" )) I spoke to one Brit who was learning Russian, and he didn't realize that the soft sign in the end of words like "ночь", "дочь" etc are only the indication of gender, but the "ч" itself is always soft. He thought we had two different sounds, like in Serbian. Also, I found out  that most English speakers tend to "de - emphasize" grammar, simply because they don't know it. Most of them cannot tell a participle from an adjective in their own language, or even have no idea about how many tenses it has. This is, probably, the result of their education, that focuses on "spelling" (memorizing words without analyzing their morphological structure). So when they learn Russian, they expect it to be the same - irrational language with no rules. But this is so different from how we are taught. In a Russian school there is no "spelling". The course is called "morphology and orthography", which is followed by "syntax and punctuation". Just like that - in order to know orthography you have to know morphology, and in order to know punctuation you need to study syntax first. And there is no way to de-emphasize it.

I am Polish and I have to say that Russian is EZ once you overcome the alphabet problem. Russian has one case less than Polish, there is way less rule exceptions in it and the orography isn't as insane as in Polish. The most difficult thing about Russian was learning how to accent specific vowels precisely, because in Polish the stress is almost always at the second to last syllable, but most importantly nobody cares nor thinks about it and even if speak everything flat it is still ok.

perfective aspect in russian along with finished action also delivers terminative meaning e.g.
seek - искать - process (durative)
find - найти     - process is finished and can't last anymore and has nothing to do with present action  (terminative)
examples are not very good(they are of different roots lol ), but they reveal core of this grammar issue.
It is often confused with present perfect which of course has nothing to do with the subject. beacause in english perfect the question "whether action is finished" remains open.

45 common Russian conjunctions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4uRED9MLI
"Da" means "Yes." But this video is about conjunctions. So, there is also a conjunction "da" which can mean "and" or "but."
Да, тут без ста грамм интуристу не разобраться! Хотел было ответить развёрнуто, да время поджимает: в магазин нужно бежать, да пса выгулять, уж извини. Да прибудет с тобой сила, брат! :)
Внимание вопрос: к какой части речи относится каждое из употреблённых мною слов "да" и какое несут смысловое значение?
ЗЫ: Переводить, полагаю, смысла никакого нет?)

Lol, remember learning достопримечательности, it's 21 letters and I always missed that soft sign after chatel.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDTthaug-GY
2 grammatical categories which you should understand prior to Russian cases learning. Those categories are gender and number. So, before dealing with cases, which is a completely new concept for most of you and that’s why pretty difficult to grasp, it’s highly recommended to become comfortable with a gender and a number concepts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwIHIGBsm3A
Obviously (as the title of the video suggests), in this video, we are going to speak about Russian declension. If you ask me, “What this declension has to do with Russian cases?”, my answer will be, “Everything.”
When beginners say a phrase like “Russian cases,” or when they say that “Russian cases are difficult,” they actually mean a declension (they just don’t know how to call it properly, so they call it “cases”). So, not the cases are hard for them but this Russian declension.

Usually, Russian learners emphasize the stressed syllable exactly the same as they would do it in their native language which, to tell the truth, sounds not exactly the same as Russian native speakers do things. And this causes accent.
Also, when you start learning Russian grammar, you discover (with astonishment) that Russian stress is mobile. It can move in the same word when this word alters in different cases, conjugations, forms, genders… Which some people find pretty confusing.
Plus, when learning new words, you realize that stress sometimes influences meaning. There are words that are written exactly the same but have different stressed syllables and, therefore, have completely different meanings.

Mastering C++ Multithreading by Maya Posch 
English | 2017 | ISBN: 1787121706 | 244 Pages | True PDF, EPUB, AZW3 | 10 MB

Master multithreading and concurrent processing with C++
Multithreaded applications execute multiple threads in a single processor environment, allowing developers achieve concurrency. This book will teach you the finer points of multithreading and concurrency concepts and how to apply them efficiently in C++.
Divided into three modules, we start with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of multithreading and concurrency concepts. We then take an in-depth look at how these concepts work at the hardware-level as well as how both operating systems and frameworks use these low-level functions.
In the next module, you will learn about the native multithreading and concurrency support available in C++ since the 2011 revision, synchronization and communication between threads, debugging concurrent C++ applications, and the best programming practices in C++.
In the final module, you will learn about atomic operations before moving on to apply concurrency to distributed and GPGPU-based processing. The comprehensive coverage of essential multithreading concepts means you will be able to efficiently apply multithreading concepts while coding in C++.
What You Will Learn

Deep dive into the details of the how various operating systems currently implement multithreading
Choose the best multithreading APIs when designing a new application
Explore the use of mutexes, spin-locks, and other synchronization concepts and see how to safely pass data between threads
Understand the level of API support provided by various C++ toolchains
Resolve common issues in multithreaded code and recognize common pitfalls using tools such as Memcheck, CacheGrind, DRD, Helgrind, and more
Discover the nature of atomic operations and understand how they can be useful in optimizing code
Implement a multithreaded application in a distributed computing environment
Design a C++-based GPGPU application that employs multithreading.

This accessible textbook is a “must-read” for programmers of all levels of expertise. Basic familiarity with concepts such as operations between vectors and matrices, and the Newton-Raphson method for finding the roots of non-linear equations, would be an advantage, but extensive knowledge of the underlying mathematics is not assumed.

Removing App Library Files, Caches, & Preferences
Some applications will also leave behind some preference files and caches, generally these don’t harm anything to leave around, but if you want to delete them it’s just a matter of locating the apps support files and removing those as well. If you’d rather not dig around in these files yourself, you can turn to a utility like AppCleaner to delete the application along with all of it’s respective scattered preference files, but for those who would like to do this on their own, you can typically found these type of files in the following locations.
Application Support files (can be anything from saved states, preferences, caches, temporary files, etc):
~/Library/Application Support/(App Name)

Preferences are stored at:
~/Library/Preferences/(App Name)

Caches are stored in:
~/Library/Caches/(App Name)

branch in Git is in actuality a simple file that contains the 40 character SHA-1 checksum of the commit it points to, branches are cheap to create and destroy. Creating a new branch is as quick and simple as writing 41 bytes to a file (40 characters and a newline).

which HuaWei smartphone has built-in FM tuner?
Which Android phones have offline FM radio?

Antennas
Phones with built-in radio tuners require an antenna to pick up the FM signal. The headset is used as the antenna, and this is why headsets must be connected to the phone to gain a signal. The same principle works when connecting the mobile with a jack-to-jack or jack-to-phono cable to a stereo system.

Standalone FM Radio Headsets
For phones without built-in FM radio, there is always the option to purchase a standalone FM radio headset. There are many FM radio headsets available, which connect to the phone via Bluetooth or via the headphone socket. These are a popular option for receiving FM radio on phones that do not come with built-in receivers.

Ойрадын цэрэг Хотонг дайлахад Төрбайх 13 настай оролцож байв. 1607 онд Халх,Ойрадын хооронд хямрал будлиан үүсэхэд зохицуулан эедүүлсний учир  Халхын ноёд болон Цагаан номун ханаас Төрбайхад “Гүүш” цол олгосноос хойш  ”Гүүш хаан” хэмээн алдаршив. 1635 онд V Далай ламаас тусламж хүсч элч ирэхэд ойрадын ноёд чуулалдаж, газар дээр нь урьдчилан байдлыг тандан мэдэх нь зүйтэй гэсэн шийдвэр гарчээ.Төрбайх гүүш хан Цоросын  Хотогчин нарын зэрэг арваад хүнийг авч  Лхаст очин V Далай лам Лувсанжамц, Банчин эрдэнэ нартай уулзаж, цэргийн тусламж үзүүлэхээр тохиролцжээ. 1636 оны намар Төрбайх дөрвөн Ойрадын цэргийг удирдан нутгаасаа мордож Мянган Ямаат уулын орчимд  өвөлжөөд, 1637 онд Цогт тайжийн цэрэгтэй байлдсан аж. Цус асгаруулсан ширүүн  тулалдаан болж Цогт тайж өөрөө амь үрэгдэн ойрадын цэрэг ялжээ. Түүнээс үүдэн  тулалдаан болсон газрыг  Их, бага улаан хошуу хэмээн нэрийдэх болсон хэмээн нутгийнхан домоглодог. 1638 онд V Далай лам ялалтыг нь үнэлэн Төрбайх гүүш ханд “Данзанчойжал, Цоросын Хотогчин баатарт “Эрдэнэ” цол олгосноор Эрдэнэ баатар хэмээгдэх болжээ. Гүүш хаан үлдэж цэргээ буцаахдаа Эрдэнэбаатарт Аминдара нэрт охиноо өгч ураг барилдан, өөрийн харъяатыг Хөх нуурт ирүүлэхийг хүссэн байна. Төрбайх Гүүш хааны хүсэлтийг  Дөрвөн Ойрадын чуулганы ноёд хүлээн авч, Ойрадын нутгаас Гүүш ханы албат дээр  Хошууд  Хөндлөн увш, Торгууд мэргэн жонон, Цорос Ончон сэцнийг албаттай нь Хөх нуур руу шилжүүлэн суурьшуулснаар Хөх нуурын хошуудууд гэгдэх болов. Гүүш хаан Далай лам, Банчин богдтой тохиролцсоны дагуу 1639-1640 онд Кам, 1641-1642 онд Умард Түвэдийн Үй, Цан орныг тус тус эзэлж, улааны шашинтны холбоотон Бэри аймгийн хан Донёддорж, Занба хаан Данзанвамбо нарыг устган бүх Түвэд орныг эрхшээлдээ оруулжээ. Түвэд улсад олон жил үргэлжилсэн шашин, улс төрийн тэмцэлд Гүүш хааны тусламжтайгаар шарын  бүлэглэл ялж, Түвэд орныг нэгтгэх үйл явц хэрэгжив. 1640 онд Төрбайх Гүүш хаан Тарвагатайн Улаан бураад чуулсан Халх Ойрадын чуулганд оролцож, ”Дөчин дөрвөн хоёрын их цааз”-ыг батлалцжээ. 1642 онд Түвэдийн төр, шашны тэргүүнийг өргөмжлөх ёслол болж, Гүүш хан Төрбайхыг Түвэд улсын хаан ширээнд, V Далай лам Лувсанжамцыг Түвэдийн Бурхан шашны тэргүүнээр тус тус өргөмжилжээ. Тийнхүү Түвэд, Хөх нуурын дээд засаглал нь Гүүш хааны мэдэлд оров. Гүүш хаан Түвэд, Хөх нуурын эрх баригчийн хувьд  Манж улсын хаадтай удаа дараа элч солилцон  харилцаж байв. Төрбайх хаан Хөхнуурын монголчуудыг зүүн, баруун гарт хувааж, 10 хөвүүддээ өгч захируулжээ. 1655 онд Төрбайх Гүүш хаан 73 насандаа  нас нөгчжээ. (С.Цолмон)

очир ᠸᠴᠢᠷ: truncheon, sacred instrument used in Buddhist ceremonies.
1. [шашин] Хоёр тал нь тав юмуу есөн шовгор үзүүртэй, дундуураа нарийн, нэг зүйл хөгжмийн зэмсэг, лам нар ном уншихдаа хонхтой зэрэгцүүлэн хэрэглэдэг, буддын шашинтны бат бэхийн бэлгэ тэмдэг - Зүүн гартаа хонхны очир атгасан байх ба мөргөж орсон хүний нүд рүү хурц хүйтэн харцаар ширвэн харна. Н.Батбаяр. Өндөрт хатгасан туг., очир тамга (адил талт хоёр жишүү дөрвөлжний дунд бяцхан дугуй гархи бүхий малын тамга), элдэв очир (давхар зөрүүлэгтэй очир, дэлбээгээ хумьсан лянхуа мэт агаад дөрвөн дэлбээ нь дөрвөн тив, дөрвөн зүгийн бэлгэдэл), *очир гүйлгэх (алдсан гээсэн зүйлийг мэргэлэх шашны зан үйл);
2. Бат бэхийн бэлгэ тэмдэг - Аль түүнийг баригч богд ламын өлмий очир мэт бат болтугай. Ардын заргын дэлгэрэнгүй... очир алмаас (а. Маш хатуу эрдэнийн чулуу, өнгө янз бүр, гоёл чимэглэлд чулуулаг өрөмдөхөд хэрэглэнэ; б. Талсажсан ирмэгт алмаа) - Эрт дээр үед энэ уулын орой тэр аяараа очир алмас эрдэнийн чулуугаар дүүрэн байжээ. Н.Батбаяр. Өндөрт хатгасан туг., очир эрдэнийн хурим (гэрлээд тавин жил болсноо тэмдэглэн хийх хурим);
3. [шилжсэн] Очирын орой шиг дүрс хэлбэртэй хээ угалз.

нацагдорж буюу очирын тухай: Очир нь анхандаа энэтхэгийн Индра бурханы шидэж хэрэглэдэг хүрэл шийдэм байжээ. Харин Буддын шашинд тэрээр муу муухай, хорон санаатан бүхнийг няц даран сөнөөдөг хэдий ч өөрөө хэзээ ч үл сөнөөгдөгч, бат бөх, цаг хугацааг даван туулагч эрч хүч, төгс чадлын бэлгэ тэмдэг болжээ.
Анхдагч язгуур Будда буюу “Очирбаригч" хүч чадлын нөөц ундарга болон бүх Будда бурхан, шашны багш нэг бүрийн зүрхэд хамт оршиж байдаг. Бодьсадва Очирваани буюу “Очирыг гартаа хөтлөгч” бол Чингис хаан болон монголын бусад хаад ноёдод шингэсэн Будда бурханы эрч хүчтэй, хүчирхэг мөн чанар, шинж төрхийн гадна илэрхийлэл мөн. Монголчууд бол бурханы ард түмэн.
Очир нь хонхтой хамтдаа хувраг хүний шүтээн тахилын хамгийн гол үндсэн хэрэглүүр болжээ. Очир идэвхитэй эрч хүч, эр хүнлэг үндсэн төрх байдал, гол зэвсэг эсхүл хэрэглүүр нь юм.
Харин хонх нь идэвхгүй далд хүч, эмэгтэйлэг үндсэн төрх, хурц мэргэн ухааны бэлгэдэл. Гэгээрэлд хүрэх зам мөрийг танин мэдэхэд зэвсэг хэрэглүүр болон хурц мэргэн ухаан заавал хослон нэгдэх ёстой.
Үүгээр ч Будда Шакъяамуни бурхан гэгээрэлд хүрсний учир шалтгааныг ухан тайлбарлаж болно. Учир нь тэрээр бясалгал үйлдэхдээ очир завиллаар буюу очир загалмай маягаар хөлөө загалмайлан давхар завилж сууж байсан ажээ.
Сүмд бясалгагч Будда бурхан эсхүл түүнтэй мөн чанар нэгэн болох лам хувраг нэг бол тэдний залрах олбогт нь ширсэн очир загалмай дээр суудаг эсхүл бүхний нүдэнд ил харагдахаар мөргөл, бясалгалын ширээний өмнө байрлуулсан орлуулах туг даавууг ашигладаг.
Очир хонх арга билгийн төлөөлөл болдог. Арга нь очир, хонх нь билэг. Танка зураг, барималд бурханы гарт очир байгаа нь ямар агуулгатай болохыг сонирхдог.
Энэ нь Очир алмасыг бэлэгдсэн очир хөдөлгөх хөдөлгөөн буюу мутарлага нь газрын янз бүрийн саад бартааг устгана гэж үздэг. Хүч чадал эрх мэдлийн бэлэгдэл ч гэж үздэг. Очир асар их хүч чадалтай учир лусын эздийн зөвшөөрлийг авч чаддаг хэмээн үздэг. 
Хонх бол авиа гаргана. Тэр дуу бурхны чихэнд уянгалаг сайхан эгшиг аялгуу болон хүрдэг.
Харин ад донгийн хорлол чөтгөр шулмын чихэнд тархийг хагалам тэсэхийн аргагүй хүчтэй долгион, харанга болж, муу муухай бүхнийг, атгаг хар санааг хагалан бутаргадаг гэж үздэг байна. Хонхны дуугаар дарж хөөж чадаагүй үлдсэн ад зэтгэрийг очироор нухчин дардаг. Тиймээс хонх очир хоёр нь хамтдаа байдаг учир нь энэ болно.

Цөмийн энерги ялгаруулдаг очир эрдэнийн гариг
Дэлхийгээс 4000 гэрлийн жилийн зайд орших Сүүн замд нэгэн од маш тод гэрэлтдэг нь эрдэмтдийн сонирхлыг татсаар иржээ. Тэгвэл тэр нь од биш, очир эрдэнээс бүтсэн одой гариг болохыг олон улсын одон орончид илрүүлсэн тухай “Science” сэтгүүл мэдээллээ. PSR J1719-1438 нэртэй уг гариг ердөө 20 км голчтой ч дэлхийгээс зургаа дахин хүнд жинтэй тул хамгийн их нягтралтайд тооцож байна. Тус гариг нэг минутад 10000 удаа тэнхлэгээ тойрон эргэж, очир эрдэнийн одод нь секундэд зуун удаа анивчдаг гэнэ. “Ийм хөдөлгөөний хурдыг гүйцэж харах боломж бараг үгүй. Энэ нь атомын бөмбөгтэй дүйцэх хэмжээний энерги ялгаруулдаг” хэмээн судалгааны багийн ахлагч Мэтью Бэйлс ярьжээ. “Хэдэн сая жилийн тэртээ байсан очир эрдэнийн аварга гаригийн үлдэгдэл нь PSR J1719-1438 гариг юм” хэмээн эрдэмтэд таамаглаж буй.

[Монгол Тулгатны 100 эрхэм] - С.Галсан
"Боловсролгүй боловсрол" гэх шиг зүйл ярьж байна. Энд нэг санаагаа хэлэхэд. Тэр цаана нь байгаа зүйл чинь билэг гэдэг ойлголт байх аа, уламжлалт ойлголтоор. Билэг гэдэг нь "арга" буюу бидний ойлголтоор материаллаг нөхцлийн эсрэг тал нь болов уу. Тэхээр оюун санааны дээгүүр түвшнийг билэг гэж хэлж байна гэж ойлгож болох байх аа. Түүнд байгалиас тухайн хүнд илүүтэй өгөгдсөн увдисаар хүрч болох юм. Эсвэл системтэй боловсролоор. Гэхдээ аль ч тохиолдолд хувь хүний өөрийн эрэгцүүлэл, бясалгал, хичээл чармайлт, сэтгэлгээний хүч асар их ташуур болно. Аливаа хүн байгаа бодит бололцоон дээрээ тулгуурлаад оюун чадвараа ашиглаад ямар нэг зүйл бүтээх буюу аливаа асуудлын учигийг олж байгаа тэр хавьд тухайн хүний амьдралын утга учир оршиж, үүргээ биелүүлж мөн түүнчлэн хүсэл нь гүйцэж байж болно. Тэхээр үүндээ зарцуулсан оюуны чадамжаа билэг гэж хэлээд байна аа даа? Тэр билэг нээгдсэн хүн гэдэг нь үүнийг л хэлээ болов уу. Билэг оюуны зэрэгцээ хүний нийгмийн эрхэм дээд шаардлага, хэрэгцээ болсон ухамсар гээч зүйл байна. Үүн дээр суурилсан төлөвшил, соёл иргэншил гэх ойлголт байна. Энэ бүхнийг өөртөө цогцлоож амжаад өөрийн асуудлаас давж өрөөл бусдын, нийтийн хэмжээний асуудлыг шийдэлцэх хэмжээнд очвол суутан болох гээд ч байгаа юм уу. Билгийн чанад хязгаар хүрсэн гэдэг нь энэ хавьцаа ойлголт байхаа даа. Өрний ойлголтоор бол билэг оюун боловсорсон бол educated man гэж тодорхойлж байгаа байх. Суу их чадалтаныг genius гээд байгаа байх. Манай "билэг танхай" гэх ойлголт байдаг. Энэ бол угтаа ямар ч системтэй боловсрол үгүй атал дан ганц авьяасаар нүдэх гээд байдаг, заримдаа хадуурдаг буруу зөрүү авдаг нөхдүүд, айн? Түүнийгээ өвөг дээдэс маань билэг танхай гэж "залруулж" байж. Тэхээр билэг танхай гэж байвал "энэ маань ёстой суутан болохоор хүн, даанч жаахан системтэй боловсрол олж билэг нээгдэх л хэрэгтэй байна" гэсэн санааг дагуулаад байх шиг байдаг. Тэхээр билэг танхай гэдэг бол алдар цол биш тухайн хүнд өгч буй тодорхойлолт байж болох нь.

Амбийц гэдэг үгийг тайлбарлах гэж үзье л дээ. Алив хүн өөрийн хийж буй ажил, мэргэжил, бизнесээрээ бахархах, өөртөө эрэмших зүйл байж болно. Ерөөсөө тэр зүйлийг эхлүүлж, эрхэлж байгаа нь түүний дур сонирхол, ажилдаа өгч өгч буй ач холбогдол, утга учиртай ямар нэг байдлаар холбоотой байх ёстой. Үүнийхээ хүрээнд тухайн хүн 1-рт үүгээрээ бахархах, 2-рт үүндээ ач холбогдол өгч магадгүй үүнийг нь бусад хүмүүс дэмжин тэтгээсэй гэсэн сэтгэл хөдлөл байж болно. Үүнийг л амбийц гэж байгаа юм болов уу. Тэхээр бидэнд ийм сэтгэл хөдлөл байдаг ч гэсэн тухайлан нэршсэн зүйл алга. Энэ бол техник технологийн эринтэйгээ хамт бидэнд хүрч ирсэн соёлын шинэ ойлголт болж ирж байна. Компьютерыг ТЭБМ биш компьютер гэж нэрлэж хэвшсэн шигээ үүнийг амбийц гэж нэрлээд явчих нь зүйтэй болов уу. Гэхдээ бид шинэ соёлын ойлголтод мэдрэмтгий бөгөөд туйлширч ханддаг. Тиймээс бид амбийцыг бас л хэтрүүлэн авч үзэх явдал байна. Амбийц өөрийнхөө хэм хэмжээнд байж л сая утга төгөлдөр болж харагдана. Ихдэхээрээ энэ биш болчихож байна. Монгол ойлголтоор бол барилдахаасаа таахалзах, нохойноосоо гинж нь гэх мэтчилэн хэлж болох ойлголт руу шилжчих гэмтэй юм.

сэтгэлийн дуудлагаар

Ялагдаагүй амьдрал

Төө урагшилж сөөм ухарна гэж байна шүү инээж байгаад л хорлодог хүмүүс шүү дээ хятадууд одоо ч хоол хүнс эд хэрэглэлд маань хор хийсээр л байна. Хувиа хичээсэн төрийн хэдэн арчаагүй нөхдөөс болж ард иргэд маань сөхөрч байна даа.

Энэ жил Өндөр гэгээн Занабазарын мэлмий гийсний 380 жилийн ой тохиож байгаа түүхэн жил билээ. “Их эзэн Чингис хааны хөшөө, Төрийн ёслол хүндэтгэлийн өргөө цогцолбор”-т байрладаг Монгол төрийн түүхийн музейгээс эрхлэн энэхүү түүхэн их ойг тохиолдуулан “Өндөр гэгээн Занабазар” номыг толилуулахаар болжээ.
Өндөр гэгээн Занабазар нь төр-шашны нэрт зүтгэлтэн төдийгүй дундад зууны үеийн монголын үндэсний соёл урлагийг нэгэн үе гоо зүйн танигдашгүй өндөрлөгт хүргэж чадсан уран зураач, уран барималч, оточ, хэл шинжээч, яруу найрагч зэрэг тэнгэрлиг авьяас билигтэй хосгүй нэгэн байсныг гэрчлэх дахин давтагдашгүй урлагийн хосгүй бүтээлүүд үзэгчдийн мэлмийг мялаасаар байгаа билээ. Монгол хүний урлахуйн их эрдэм ухаанаар туурвин бүтээгдэж, он цагийн шалгарлыг даван туулсаар бидэнд уламжлагдан ирсэн түүх, соёлын дурсгалт зүйлсүүдээрээ дамжуулан монгол нутаг дахь хүний амьдралын түүх, соёл урлаг, ёс заншил, байгаль орчны түүхийг сурталчлан таниулах, улмаар тэдгээрийг унаган төрхөөр нь хадгалан хамгаалж, хойч үедээ өвлүүлэн үлдээх эрхэм хүндтэй үүргийг музейн ажилтнууд хүлээдэг юм. Эл номдоо 17 дугаар зууны үеийн монголын урлаг соёлын хөгжил дэвшил тэр дундаа хүрэл цутгамлын суурь урлаг хөгжлийнхөө өндөр төвшинд хүрснийг харуулах Өндөр гэгээний өөрийн мутраар урлан бүтээсэн алдарт бүтээлүүдийн тухай, бурхадын мутрын зангаа, барьц зэргийн тайлбар болон төвд хэлээр бичигдсэн Занабазарын намтрыг багтаажээ.

Эцэг тэнгэр байгаль эхийн дөрвөн зүг, найман зовхист
Гучин гурван тэнгэр хийгээд Хурмаст тэнгэрт
Эрлэг хаан, Лусын хаан хийгээд төрсөн газрын савдагт
Халх төрийн Соёмбот сүлд, сахиусан тэнгэр Гарид танаа
Амьтай амьгүй шүтээн хийгээд өвөг дээдсийн онгон сахиусуудад 
Хамаг Монголын гурван эрдэнийг итгэж сүслэн даатгая.
Энэхүү хийморийг дарцагийг хийсгэснээр
Нар, сар, гал гурван эрдэнэ явах замыг минь гэрэлтүүл
Онгод, ном, багш гурван эрдэнэ итгэлийг минь батжуул
Хань ижил, үр хүүхэд, гал голомт гурван эрдэнэ сэтгэлийг минь баясга
Нэр төр, авъяас билиг, ажил мэргэжил гурван эрдэнэ ноёлох өндөрлөгт намайг хүргэ.

Шонхор шиг нисэх, морь шиг зүтгэх, нохой шиг хайчлах, хүн шиг амьдрах
(Эр хүн) миний сүлд хийморийг дээш босго

Жигүүртэн шувууд жигүүрэндээ хүчтэй,
Араатан амьтан араандаа хүчтэй,
Адгуус амьтан шөрмөстэй,
Монгол хүн оюундаа хүчтэй байх болтугай.

Энх амгалангийн цагт цэнгэлийн манлайд хүрэх
Хүссэн юм бүхэн хийгээд есөн хүсэл санасанаар бүтэх өлзий хутаг оршиг.
Миний явдал суудал, ярих тэргүүнтэн өөрт өрөөлд халгүй байж
Миний амь нас, сүнс сүлд, хувь заяа сэтгэлийн буян мэт арвижин уртсаж
Ясны хаан, махны хатан минь хурц оршиг.

Үл зохилдох элдэв дайсан, далдаар хорлогчидын хараасан хараал нь хар толгой дээр нь буцаг.
Хатгалдах дайсан ирэх аваас ялах үйлийг зохиож миний Монгол мөнх оршиг.

Karakorum (Khalkha Mongolian: Хархорум Kharkhorum) was the capital of the Mongol Empire between 1235 and 1260, and of the Northern Yuan in the 14–15th centuries. Its ruins lie in the northwestern corner of the Övörkhangai Province of Mongolia, near today's town of Kharkhorin, and adjacent to the Erdene Zuu monastery. They are part of the upper part of the World Heritage site Orkhon Valley.

Easy step by step how to install and configure Shadowsocks in Ubuntu Server.
Install Shadowsocks:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools m2crypto
sudo pip install shadowsocks

change Mac's name using the OS X Terminal (tested on Mac OS X 10.13.6):
if you have a Mac connected to your network without a display running as an iTunes or other media server, then you may only ever interact with your Mac via SSH in the Terminal.
Type in the following command, replacing "name" with a user-friendly name that will identify the computer:

scutil --set ComputerName "name"

Once you press return, this name will be set. Next, type the following command, replacing "name" with the name that you wish to display on your local network to Bonjour-based services:
scutil --set LocalHostName "name"

Finally, you can also configure and set how the computer is displayed when connecting through SSH, and the name shown inside of the Terminal by typing the following command, replacing "name" with the name you want to use to display in the Terminal and when connecting to the machine over SSH:
scutil --set HostName "name"

Note: When specifying a LocalHostName and HostName, you should not have spaces in the name. After you press return for each of the items above, you will be prompted to enter your administrator password to authenticate the changes.

After you've set all of these items, you can type this command into the Terminal to ensure that the proper items were set:
scutil --get HostName

    "local_port":1080,
    "password":"",
    "timeout":300,
    "method":"aes-256-cfb",
    "fast_open":false
}

Command to control shadowsocks:

sudo ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start
sudo ssserver -d stop
sudo ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d restart

SSH
https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3887/is-using-a-public-key-for-logging-in-to-ssh-any-better-than-saving-a-password
The use of the session identifier in publickey authentication has an interesting effect not often remarked on: it affords extra protection against a man-in-the-middle attack. If the attacker executes the key exchange separately on each side, the session identifiers (IDs) will be different. The server demands a signature over the ID for its connection with the attacker -- but the client will only produce a signature over the ID on its side. The attacker has no way to force them to be the same, and no way to induce the client to do anything else. A challenge-response protocol would not do this.

I fear that some readers will miss the implications of “long and random passwords”. A private key carries a lot more entropy than a realistic password (let's say at least 128 bits of entropy, assuming a decent RNG; a 10-ASCII-character password has about half that, a lot less if it's memorable). Also people reuse passwords a lot more often than private keys. So in practice there are security advantages to a private key. – Gilles May 17 '11 at 16:59
@Gilles asymmetric keys like those used in SSH all have at least 1024 bits of entropy, not 128. However asymmetric encryption also requires more entropy. 1024 bit asymmetric is weaker than 128 bit symmetric encryption. When somebody tries to brute force an SSH server, they have to do it "slowly" to avoid creating a denial of service attack. This means a password with ~50 bits of entropy will take hundreds of millions of years to guess. Go any faster and the server will be blown off the internet for the duration of the attack, and the sysadmin is going to notice/investigate. – Abhi Beckert Feb 21 '16 at 6:48 
To effectively brute force a 10 character password you need hundreds of trillions of guesses per second, and it'll still take weeks. No server is capable of receiving anything remotely close to that many SSH login attempts. A few hundred attempts per second is more realistic, which is too slow to be effective unless the password is terrible. Anybody reading this website is smart enough to choose a good password. – Abhi Beckert Feb 21 '16 at 6:50 

@AbhiBeckert I think you're confusing key size with entropy. Also, breaking the key or password isn't always have to be an online attack: the attacker may have access to the public key. In any case I think you missed my point altogether: the entropy in a key pair, barring bugs, is always far larger than any memorable passwords. – Gilles Feb 21 '16 at 13:09

- Shift + Fn Down for PageDown, 
- Shift + Fn Left for Home,

And starting with Yosemite it seems to be 
- Fn Up for PageUp,

c++ ed25519 SHA256 implementation

ssh-keygen -o -a 4096 -t ed25519 -C 'comment field'

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys
Note: If you set a passphrase for your key, it is strongly encouraged to use the -o option to ssh-keygen. This will save your private key in the new OpenSSH format, which has greatly increased resistance to brute-force password cracking, but is not supported by versions of OpenSSH prior to 6.5. According to ssh-keygen(1), Ed25519 keys always use the new private key format. Also use the -a switch to specify the number of KDF rounds on the password encryption.
You can also add an optional comment field to the public key with the -C switch, to more easily identify it in places such as ~/.ssh/known_hosts, ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and ssh-add -L output. For example:
$ ssh-keygen -C "$(whoami)@$(hostname)-$(date -Ins)" #"date -Ins" is linux only, e.g. 2018-08-15T15:08:15,930394983+08:00
will add a comment saying which user created the key on which machine and when.

Apple Mac компьютер дээр Монгол крилл үсгээр 
яаж бичих вэ (Copy Paste хийх боломжтой)
Сайн уу Андууд аа,

Өнөөдрийг хүртэл Apple компани MAC компьютерийн үйлдлийн системдээ Монгол Крилл үсгээр бичих боломжийг олгоогүй л байна. (Интернэтэд хэд хэдэн Монгол гарын программ байгаа боловч Таслах-Хуулах-Буулгах боломжгүй (Copy-Paste), өдөр тутам ашиглахад хүндрэлтэй байдаг)

Ингээд Монголоор бичиж байхдаа Copy-Paste хийх боломжтой гарын программыг цоо шинээр бичихээр шийдсэн юм.

Та бүхэн доорхи хаягаар орж файлыг татаж аваарай.

Суулгах заавар хуучнаараа:

1. Татаж авсан файлыг нээхэд дотор нь 2ш файл байгаа.
2. Дээрхи 2 файлыг /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ хавтсанд хуулж тавина.
(Энэ хавтсыг нээхдээ Finder -аа нээж байгаад "Command+Shift+G" дараад /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ гэж бичнэ)
(Updated 2015.12.2: Нөхөд өө, энэ хавтас бровс хийж гарч ирэхгуй шүү, системийн нуусан хавтас юм. Зааврын дагуу яг бичвэл нээгдэнэ.)
3. Дараа нь System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources цонхыг нээгээд доор байгаа + товч дарна
4. Дээрээс хоёрт байгаа "Others" -ийг дараад "Mongolian"-ийг сонгоорой.

Суулгаад Mongolian-ийг сонгосны дараа хэрэв крилл байтугай юу ч үсэг гарахгүй бол түр хүлээгээд үзээрэй, 1-2 мин.

Санал сэтгэгдэл байвал Коммент үлдээгээрэй ( bmr333@gmail.com )

Isomorphic JavaScript Web Development by Tomas Alabes 
English | 2017 | ISBN: 1785889769 | 226 Pages | True PDF, EPUB, AZW3 | 16 MB

Universal JavaScript with React and Node
Leverage the power of React and Node to build complete web applications in pure JavaScript
The latest trend in web development, Isomorphic JavaScript, allows developers to overcome some of the shortcomings of single-page applications by running the same code on the server as well as on the client. Leading this trend is React, which, when coupled with Node, allows developers to build JavaScript apps that are much faster and more SEO-friendly than single-page applications.
This book begins by showing you how to develop frontend components in React. It will then show you how to bind these components to back-end web services that leverage the power of Node. You'll see how web services can be used with React code to offload and maintain the application logic. By the end of this book, you will be able to save a significant amount of development time by learning to combine React and Node to code fast, scalable apps in pure JavaScript.
What You Will Learn

Build on the client side with the awesomeness of React
Style your application effectively
Render the server side using React
Implement a GraphQL server based on Node, Express, and SQL
Fetch application data using Relay
Build an isomorphic router to use in the application
Deploy your application to a cloud host
Secure your application with a solid token-based authentication system

To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

ブログで稼げる人と稼げない人の差はどこにあるか。
もっとも大きいのは「自分のやり方を見つけられるか否か」だと感じています。
稼げない人って、オリジナルな方法を開発せず、当たり障りのない猿真似に終始しているんですよね。
猿真似はすぐに陳腐化するので、努力が資産になりにくい。

残業続きなのはもちろん、毎日会社の成績のことばかりで頭がいっぱい、緊張状態を強いれられているようでは、副業はおろか、プライベートな活動を楽しむ余裕すらなくなります。

Packages provide convenient ways of enabling and disabling certain debug lines when you start the application. For example, with debug it is possible to prevent any debug lines from being printed to the terminal by not setting the DEBUG environment variable. Using it is simple:
// app.js
var debug = require(‘debug’)(‘app’)
debug(’Hello, %s!’, ‘world’)
To enable debug lines, simply run this code with the environment variable DEBUG set to “app” or “*”:
DEBUG=app node app.js

Filter is used to SKIP unwanted items, and might return with less items or even NO items.
Map modifies the items, and will always return the same amount of items.
>filter returns ONLY the items that meet the criteria you specify in the callback. It's sort of like .map + an if statement.

Netfilter is a framework provided by Linux that allows various networking-related operations to be implemented in the form of customized handlers. Netfilter offers various functions and operations for packet filtering, network address translation, and port translation, which provide the functionality required for directing packets through a network, as well as for providing ability to prohibit packets from reaching sensitive locations within a computer network.

Netfilter represents a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel, allowing specific kernel modules to register callback functions with the kernel's networking stack. Those functions, usually applied to the traffic in the form of filtering and modification rules, are called for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the networking stack.

Deleting Old Local Branches
http://erikaybar.name/git-deleting-old-local-branches/
First, be sure to prune your remote branches
	git remote prune origin  
and then
	git branch -vv | grep 'origin/.*: gone]' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs git branch -d
4b) Review/edit list before deleting
If you want to review and/or edit the list of branches before deleting them. One way to accomplish this is to pipe the branch names into your clipboard via pbcopy, paste them into your favorite editor, and then pipe them into git branch -d yourself. Example:

Pipe list into your clipboard via git branch -vv | grep 'origin/.*: gone]' | awk '{print $1}' | pbcopy
Paste into editor. Review. Edit as needed.
Copy the edited list back into your clipboard.
Pipe clipboard into commmand via: pbpaste | xargs git branch -d.

If the remote branch you want to checkout is under "New remote branches" and not "Tracked remote branches" then you need to fetch them first:
git remote update
git fetch
Now it should work:
git checkout -b local-name origin/remote-name
Important Comment:
If you are trying to do this for a remote that you explicitly added (so anything other than origin) you will need to do git remote update before your fetch will fetch that remote. Otherwise you get messages like: Did you intend to checkout 'upstream-repo/master' which can not be resolved as commit?

Here is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.
    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:
    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> note_bfr

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:zhirshya/zhirshya.github.io.git
No need to manually rename the repo via browser on github.com? Will only pushing from local repo after the above command automatically suffice?

If you want to completely delete the files/dirs from your local and the remote repository, you can:
1.remove the files/dirs: git rm -r <file/dir>
2.commit with amend flag: git commit --amend
The amend flag tells git to commit again, but "merge" (not in the sense of merging two branches) this commit with the last commit.
3. git merge --continue

>* trailing whitespace
4. git add .

copy the content of a branch to a new local branch:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14998923/how-can-i-copy-the-content-of-a-branch-to-a-new-local-branch
git checkout -b new_branch old_branch
Or even shorter git checkout -b new_branch (when you're already on old_branch). 
>>I think if one creates a new branch like this one doesn't instantly have a copy of the old branch but simply a new pointer at the head of the old branch. But when you now do something like rebasing the new branch you should see that the old branch is still in its original state while the new branch is modified. So I think that does what the OP wants.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21101572/git-diff-between-file-in-local-repo-and-origin
To view the differences going from the remote file to the local file:
	git diff remotename/branchname:remote/path/file1.txt local/path/file1.txt
To view the differences in the other direction:
	git diff HEAD:local/path/file1.txt remotename/branchname:remote/path/file1.txt
Basically you can diff any two files anywhere using this notation:
	git diff ref1:path/to/file1 ref2:path/to/file2
As usual, ref1 and ref2 could be branch names, remotename/branchname, commit SHAs, etc.

What chemical elements do human bodies comprise of?
Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Only about 0.85% is composed of another five elements: potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium. All 11 are necessary for life. The remaining elements are trace elements, of which more than a dozen are thought on the basis of good evidence to be necessary for life. All of the mass of the trace elements put together (less than 10 grams for a human body) do not add up to the body mass of magnesium, the least common of the 11 non-trace elements.

Python Machine Learning Cookbook: Practical solutions from preprocessing to deep learning by Chris Albon 
English | 2018 | ISBN: 1491989388 | 336 Pages | EPUB | 10 MB

This practical guide provides nearly 200 self-contained recipes to help you solve machine learning challenges you may encounter in your daily work. If you’re comfortable with Python and its libraries, including pandas and scikit-learn, you’ll be able to address specific problems such as loading data, handling text or numerical data, model selection, and dimensionality reduction and many other topics.
Each recipe includes code that you can copy and paste into a toy dataset to ensure that it actually works. From there, you can insert, combine, or adapt the code to help construct your application. Recipes also include a discussion that explains the solution and provides meaningful context. This cookbook takes you beyond theory and concepts by providing the nuts and bolts you need to construct working machine learning applications.
You’ll find recipes for:

Vectors, matrices, and arrays
Handling numerical and categorical data, text, images, and dates and times
Dimensionality reduction using feature extraction or feature selection
Model evaluation and selection
Linear and logical regression, trees and forests, and k-nearest neighbors
Support vector machines (SVM), naïve Bayes, clustering, and neural networks
Saving and loading trained models

Jordan Peterson is asked the question how should one take notes from books and lectures. 
1) don't write notes while the lecture is taking place. so, you can practice the ability to retain and recall information.
2) when reading books don't highlight or underline. read a bit of the material. then, write down what you are thinking or what you remember in the context of what you are thinking about.
Jordan Peterson explains how he is able to extemporaneously come out with his subject matter during a lecture
When he reads he marks interesting ideas mentally then figures out how they relate to all the other ideas he knows. 
do I believe it?
how might I criticize it?
It is this method that enables you recall information because you make it apart of yourself.
So, separate the actions of reading and note taking.
Read, write, Think or Read, Think, and reformulate the sentence.

automotive:
A throttle is the mechanism by which fluid flow is managed by the constriction or obstruction.
An engine's power can be increased or decreased by the restriction of inlet gases (by the use of a throttle), but usually decreased. The term throttle has come to refer, informally and incorrectly, to any mechanism by which the power or speed of an engine is regulated, such as a car's accelerator pedal. What is often termed a throttle (in an aviation context) is more correctly called a thrust lever, particularly for jet engine powered aircraft. For a steam engine, the steam valve that sets the engine speed/power is often known as a regulator.

https://www.driving-test-success.com/car-terminology.htm
Under Steer: If when driving through a bend the steering wheel doesn't turn the wheels as much as you want then the car has under steer.
Over Steer: If when driving through a bend and the rear wheels fail to follow the front wheels and instead veer towards the outside of the turn, you are experiencing over steer.

control oversteer
highway entrance ramp
heel-toe downshifting: Heel-and-toe shifting[1] is an advanced driving technique used mostly in performance driving with a manual gearbox,[2] although some drivers use it on the road in everyday conditions in the interest of effectiveness. It involves operating the throttle and brake pedals simultaneously with the right foot, while facilitating normal activation of the clutch with the left foot. It is used when braking and downshifting simultaneously (prior to entering a turn), and allows the driver to "blip" the throttle to raise the engine speed and smoothly engage the lower gear. (See Synchronized transmission.) Obsoleted by prevalence of Automatic transmission and specifically Dual-clutch transmission in performance applications that provide on-demand downshifting with rev matching faster and more reliably than a driver can do manually.

2-Point Reverse Turn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrefrsJHXuM

4 Point Turn formerly known as a 3 Point Turn 1st movement

I completely agree with getting people to start learning the catch or bite point of the clutch first then learning to hover the throttle.
If you live in an area with a lot of traffic, better start working out your right leg because your left one will start to bulk! I have been sore before simply from being in a traffic jam for a few hours.
Learning the clutch pedal "bite" point is the first thing I always teach too. I just have them get the car started by moving the clutch only, then push it back all the way in. Repeat this step over and over until they can do it quickly, then slowly add in the gas pedal.

Parallel Parking
1. Pull up until you’re almost even with the car in front of you, but not quite.
2. Crank the steering wheel toward the curb, and start backing up.
3. Once the rear wheel of the curb-facing side of your car is even with the street-facing side of the first car, straighten the steering wheel and continue reversing.
4. When the rear wheel of the street-facing side of your car is even with the street-facing side of the other, crank the steering wheel in the opposite direction.

parallel parking, backing up straight, and three- or four-point turns
https://www.wikihow.com/Pass-Your-Driving-Test
Should I turn and look behind me when parallel parking, or only use my mirrors?
You should do a full sweep before beginning the maneuver, and then drive in reverse while looking out your rear window. Once you get to the point where you need to start worrying about lining up with the curb, switch your attention to your mirrors, but still only use them as aids.

If and when your instructor asks you to park, be sure to remember the three special words. Mirror, Signal, Blind spot.
A green light never really means "go!" when you make a turn. If you're turning across an intersection at a green light, wait to see if the cars in the other lane have a red light.
Once you passed you can take extra driving lessons to reduce your premium on your Car Insurance.

We're rapidly headed toward the next 2008 financial implosion. In 3 years real estate will probably be about half what it currently is. Last time around I held off on buying a house and instead I doubled down and paid off my old condo. Then in 2012 when the recession bottomed out I cashed in silver for a down payment on my current house, which I got for 160k and now it's worth about 300k. Then I waited for the market to recover and sold my condo in 2015 and knocked out half the house mortgage. Also I started buying bitcoins during the horrible bitcoin bear market of 2014 and 2015 and tucked away a nice stash of bitcoins. I cashed in bitcoins last year and paid off the house.
I'd stay out of stocks and real estate right now and instead go into silver and bitcoins. Then when the panic of this next big economic implosion drives the prices of those assets up (and drives the price of stocks and real estate dramatically down) then I'll sell some of those assets to move into stocks. I own my house mortgage free so it's a nice low cost base of operations while I stack bitcoins before the next big run-up.
>VERY good point on SLV. The GLD/SLV ratio is '81' which historically is VERY high. SLV should rally versus GLD thus balancing it out. Example: Buying 100oz bars for less than $1900 probably have a low downside and nice upside.

Yeah, silver is still close to the bottom of it's cycle. The downside risk is almost nonexistent. I have an ammo box full of silver and I'm holing onto it. Last time around my gold gained 70% while my silver gained 260%. If I choose to keep precious metals once this next recession bottoms out I'll flip it over to gold. Once we moved into the recovery portion of the business cycle, in 2012 and later, the price of silver dropped back to it's pre-2008 price while gold maintained more of it's value.
Next time the bitcoin price goes nuts I'll start moving my surplus monthly income into silver.

learning:
How to study effectively with 6 essential skills. Boost your study performance with strategies recommended by science - The ANSWER Method.
Imagine you are studying neural communication, maybe in a biology, neuroscience, or psychology class. 

How does neural communication work? If we look at one neuron, the dendrites receive messages from many other neurons, and then the messages converge in the soma. If there is enough of a positive charge within the soma, then an action potential will occur, and an electrical signal goes down the axon. When the signal reaches the terminal buttons, neurotransmitters release into the synapse where they communicate with the dendrites of the next neuron.

Why does this happen? The neurotransmitters are chemicals that allow neurons to communicate with one another. The pattern of activation among different neurons (which neurons fire, how quickly, what neurotransmitters they release) determines the message in your brain. 

You might then ask, how does the axon work? The axon is a long tail-like structure that produces the electrical signal. 

How does the signal travel? The axon is covered in myelin sheath, a fatty substance that insulates the axon. The myelin sheath works like the rubber around the cord of an electrical appliance, and it serves to make the electricity travel faster.

Why have myelin sheath? Because we need our neurons to be able to send signals fast, since we need to be able to react, make decisions, move quickly, perceive feeling in our skin instantly, etc.

Make sure to compare ideas to learn how they are similar and different. For example, an axon and terminal buttons are both parts of a neuron; but, the axon sends an electrical signal while the terminal buttons release chemicals. Both Schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease are related to the neurotransmitter dopamine, but Schizophrenia is the result of too much dopamine while Parkinson’s disease is the result of too little dopamine. 

Also, try to make connections to your own memories or experiences, and compare ideas to learn how they are similar and different. We already made the connection from myelin sheath on axons to the rubber on cords to electrical appliances. 

Here is another example: a family member or close friend who suffers from Schizophrenia disease is suffering from too much dopamine. This means that too much dopamine is being released, by the terminal buttons, into the synapse. A doctor could give them a drug to reduce the dopamine in their brain, called a dopamine antagonist. If too much of this drug is used, the patient might begin developing symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease. 

How would a dopamine antagonist work? … continue asking yourself elaborative questions!

Dealing with line endings and Git's autocrlf
If autogen.sh produces output like the following:

./autogen.sh: line 1: $':\r': command not found
' '--srcdir=/home/user/libreoffice' '--enable-option-checking=fatal'
configure: WARNING: you should use --build, --host, --target
configure: WARNING: invalid host type:

********************************************************************

' not recognizedystem type... Invalid configuration `
 failedre: error: /bin/bash ./config.sub 
Error running configure at ./autogen.sh line 241.
... then you probably have line ending problems. This might occur if you mistakenly set Git's core.autocrlf=true.

To fix the issue, run these commands (WARNING: uncommitted changes will be lost!):

git config --unset core.autocrlf
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard
git clean -x -f
./autogen.sh

https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/136821/unit-test-fails-while-building-libreoffice/?answer=151690#post-id-151690
Hello, my first time build/make of Libreoffice clone from official repo failed with 2 errors: "Run: 88   Failure total: 2   Failures: 2   Errors: 0", I didn't use "build-nocheck", I found other person was suggested to build with "build-nocheck" option.
But https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/GenericBuildingHints#Build_system_internals says:"make performs a number of checks (e.g. unit tests). That is a subset make check tests. There is a build-nocheck switch that disables the checks when building. It may speed up the build considerably. However, it should definitely not be used when building for the first time, because otherwise you may miss a problem with your setup that will give you a build with strange behavior that nobody else sees."
I can't build/make with no errors on MacBook Pro2011/macOS 10.13.4 with latest Xcode and its commandline tools.
Commands I used was:"${LODE_HOME}/opt/bin/make clean && ${LODE_HOME}/opt/bin/make -s ENABLE_SYMBOLS=true 2>&1"

First time I heard about pornography from friends was around 8. 
Since 10, I watched a lot upper-body-naked copulation scenes (mostly western, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japanese) which were prevalent in TV dramas and movies.
Even erotic writings and passionate-kissing-only scenes have always caused small amount of urine or prostatic fluid discharge on me. I don't know whether it's normal or not.
Neither my parents, relatives, friends nor schools educated me about sex and reproductive health.
Since 2004, I noticed I urinate more frequently than other men.
My left testicle is little bit larger. Even worse, I have experienced most of symptoms stated by "Eminent doctors of the West" and described in this article.
I have always been skinny, weak and cold(flu)-prone.
I'm 34 now, virgin and have no girlfriend.
I'm concerned whether I'm able to father a child if I can get married.
Do I need to see urologist?

Hello Victor, I want to start a blog after reading your "blog business" for getting out of chronically underpaid and unstable job. Would you tell me how to receive blogging income if the contents, layouts, hostname, SEO, ads and traffic etc are done correctly?

The periodic table has issued as a 2D structure. The transition metals (d block) and espesially the lanthanides (f-block) technically slot in and expand the table in ways that make it less useful, ideally it needs a 3D treatment or perhaps an expandable view.
One issue: The atomic numbers are incrementing by five for each element.  To fix this, in css3d_periodictable.html change:
number.textContent = i + 1;
to
number.textContent = (i/5) + 1;

http://threejs.org/examples/css3d_periodictable.html
http://graphoverflow.com/graphs/3d-periodic-table.html

Here's where I'm stuck "element.onclick=function() {console.log('x');}" works like a charm, no issues there, but if I assign an id to the element "element.id = i;" and then try "element.onclick=function() {console.log(element.id)}" it prints the last index of the array always, no matter on what element I click on. I even tried "object.element.onclick=function() {console.log(object.element.id)}", and it's the same. I maybe missing something very basic or I maybe not very good in understanding certain javascript concepts. Either which ways now I'm trying to cast a ray on mouse down and see if I can identify the CSS3DObject that intersects it and through that get access to the element inside it. What I'm basically trying to do is extending the demo, and trying to center and focus the camera on each item that was clicked on, of the periodic table and show a little tool tip.

What about enabling right-clicking to help us open the web inspector in a desktop browser, by adding something like the following into your click/mousedown handlers:
if (e.which !== 1 || e.ctrlKey || e.altKey) { return; } ?

why do you use translate3d(-50%, -50%, 0px) in addition to matrix3d on each element? Doesn't it give browser more work to do?

there is a lot of semi-advanced stuff in the starter project. If you don’t know Docker, it might be confusing. It also has several webpack configs that can be hard to follow if you’re not super familiar with webpack. There are util folders in the client and server of the application that can be hard to understand for those new to React, Node, or testing with JavaScript. There may also be things in the application template that you don’t need or want if you use a different testing framework, mocking library, or build service.

buy two gallon jugs of water and slide them on either side of a pole or bamboo stick. If you're worried about the weight shifting, tie socks on both sides of each jug handle to keep them in place. It's that easy.

Mike, can you do a tutorial on how to achieve good lip seal and what good lip seal looks like compared  to bad lip seal?
Since you've treated quite a few patients  now, I'm sure you've seen a pattern and I'm assuming good lip seal helps speed up the forward and upward maxillary rotation 
Would highly appreciate if you could do a video specifically  on good lip seal (following on from  mackenzie tin chuck, shoulder and back posture etc).
>I'd love to see it too.  The key idea though is to try to keep your lips shut with the minimal amount of effort from the surrounding muscles of the face to achieve it as possible.  That can be problematic depending on the length of your face, but the more you improve it the more forces you will prevent from counteracting the force of the tongue against the roof of the mouth and that can only help with jaw expansion and getting the maxilla to move in the right direction.
So try to keep the lips definitely sealed so that there is a vacuum in your mouth, but make sure it's as light as possible and that your face is as relaxed as you can make it.

medical tape
Just use the 3M micropore tape that comes in inexpensive rolls.
fold lips inwards before taping.

The neck doesn't support the jaw, the jaw supported the tongue. If you want to reverse the jaw sinking then you have to use your tongue to support your entire mid face by mewing. I'll link you a playlist for mewing and the correct sleeping position! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCiZUKnDf0Y 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-PUlLHndQMP9mmRQpJL6h1aFSxkV-6RT

Another interesting bit was doing sets of tip of tongue to palate - 10 sec reps 10 reps is one set. Do five sets. Goal is to sleep with tongue on palate and wake up like that. Tongue push ups is another exercise. That sounds like Mew’s methods in a nutshell. Correct me if I am wrong.

Enable port forwarding to the Mac for incoming SMB and VNC services on your Internet router. How this is done varies depending on the router and again you may need to Google. Some routers are compatible with dynamic DNS services, which means you can use the same hostname without worrying about a changing IP address.
Once port forwarding is setup, to open a file sharing connection to the remote Mac from a Windows computer, open the Start menu and in the Search field type two backslashes, followed by the Internet address or dynamic DNS hostname of the router (e.g. \\keirmac.dyndns.com). With a Linux desktop environment, choose to connect to a server and enter smb:// followed by the address (e.g. smb://keirmac.dyndns.com). For screen sharing, use a VNC client on Windows or Linux and simply type the address when prompted.
Macs come with Secure Shell (SSH) built-in to enable you to connect remotely to the command-line. Enabling SSH is as simple as putting a tick alongside Remote Login within the Sharing pane of System Preferences on the home or office Mac. Again, to access the remote Mac across the Internet you’ll need to enable SSH port forwarding on the router.

ccache is short for compiler cache - and it is exactly that.

https://askubuntu.com/questions/3697/how-do-i-install-fonts
Font files that are placed in the hidden .fonts directory of your home folder will automatically be available. You can also place them in the ~/.local/share/fonts directory on newer versions of Ubuntu per the comments below.
You can also double-click on the font file (or select Open with Font Viewer in the right-click menu). Then click the Install Font button.
If you need the fonts to be available system-wide, you'll need to copy them to /usr/local/share/fonts and reboot (or manually rebuild the font cache with fc-cache -f -v).
You can confirm they are installed correctly by running fc-list | grep "<name-of-font>"
You may need to restart some programs, like OpenOffice Writer, before they actually show the new fonts (usually such programs are caching the font list when they start up).

Electric Pressure Cooker Buying Guide:
The general believe is that non-stick items and pressure cookers are not always mixing well. On the other hand, an electric pressure cooker of high quality can last long, provided that you choose the one. If you choose the one with non-stick finish, you may find it necessary to get it replaced sooner than you think.
Avoid Non-Stick
We would recommend that you avoid non-stick pressure cookers for several reasons.  The first is the simple fact that the non-stick surface simply does not last.  The second and most important is the health issue surrounding non-stick coatings.  We won’t go into the debate about the safety or lack of safety when using non-stick coating in cookware but we will say that we have chosen as a family to simply avoid it when at all possible.
Stainless Steel & Three-Ply Bottom
Choose a pressure cooker that is made of high-quality durable stainless steel.   Not all stainless steel is the same. Look for the label or bottom stamp to indicate “18/10 Stainless Steel” (a composition of 18% chromium and 10% nickel) which indicates the makeup of the metal.  Chromium and nickel add the following advantages:
Stain and corrosion resistance. (stainless steel must include at least 10.5% chromium to be considered stainless.  A greater amount of chromium adds to its durability)
Shine. (nickel works to increase the protective layer that chromium forms and also adds gleam and shine)

How Elon Musk learns faster and better than everyone else
https://qz.com/968101/how-elon-musk-learns-faster-and-better-than-everyone-else/
I call people like Musk “expert-generalists” (a term coined by Orit Gadiesh, chairman of Bain & Company). Expert-generalists study widely in many different fields, understand deeper principles that connect those fields, and then apply the principles to their core specialty.
Based on my review of Musk’s life and the academic literature related to learning and expertise, I’m convinced that we should all learn across multiple fields in order to increase our odds of breakthrough success.

StrongLifts 5x5 Workout A: FULL Video (Official)
Nikhil Das Nomula:

Never go straight into work weight sets
Do your light warmer sets to practice form
No cardio before 
Start with empty bar, add weight till you reach work weight

Squats:
----------------
2 sets of 5 with empty bar (no rest as weight is too easy)
1 set of 5 with 95(25lb) (no rest as weight is too easy)
1 set of 5 with 132(45lb plates) (no rest as weight is too easy)

5 sets of 5 with 185 (a minute rest here)

Breathing: Do not exhale at the bottom of the squat, you can exhale while you are going up
Go as fast you can while you go up.
Lifting fast will get you a lot stronger.
The reason squats go first, is that it is a king of all exercises, it works legs, abs, upper body. It is the most effective exercise to gain muscle. 

Bench press:
---------------------
No rest between exercises, only thing you do is set up the equipment

2 set of 5 reps with empty bar 
1 set of 3 reps with 95lbs(25lb)
5 sets of 5 reps with 135 lbs(45lb plates)

Hit your chest on every single rep
Use full range of motion
Used thumbs grip around, wrap your thumbs around the bar
Do not use thumbless grip

1 min rest is fine when doing actual 5x5
as the weight starts increasing, take 3 mins between 5x5 sets
When you start to miss reps, take 5 minutes rest
Take a big breath at the top, you hold it lower the weight, still hold it, do not exhale at the bottom of the chest, slowly exhale as you are coming up

Barbell row(This is not clear, I need to watch the video again to come up with better notes)
--------------
No rest 

Immedidately start with 135 lbs - as it is impossible to do this without that weight

1 set of 5 reps with 135 lbs, 
Always start with bar on the floor with every rep, 
Keep the bar closer to chins
Pull with your arms and elbows.

BloomFilterWrap.cpp:72:21: error: no matching constructor for initialization of 'String::Utf8Value'

Electron[45746:2762100] *** WARNING: Textured window <AtomNSWindow: 0x7ff8adef35b0> is getting an implicitly transparent titlebar. This will break when linking against newer SDKs. Use NSWindow's -titlebarAppearsTransparent=YES instead.

Electron App is still a server-client architecture. Serialport runs fine on the main thread, that is the "server-side" (node.js). Calling Serialport from the renderer, which is the Angular 2 part, is not possible due to security restrictions. fs is a node.js module, that is simply not available to the render thread / scope.
Browser-Serialport does not cause this error, but it also does not work at all (no port listings, nothing). Plus, Browser-Serialport does not provide TypeScript typings (at least as npm @types/ package), so its not practical for me.
The correct way to use SerialPort inside an Electron App is to call all functions from the main thread. This is every js-module that is required from the main.js that Electron starts as entry point. The interconnection to the renderer goes through Electron's ipcMain tunnel.
