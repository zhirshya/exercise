:sort u (Uniq - Removing duplicate lines, sort all lines and remove duplicates (keeping unique lines))

#replace space with new line
Use Control-v and then Enter key instead of \n. Control-v is the special character escape key.

#insert timestamp in Vim
:r! date "+\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%S"
:r !date +%F
The above commands insert the output of the date program after the current line. If wanted, the !! command can be used to filter the current line, replacing it with the output of date.

W: Move forward a WORD (any non-whitespace characters).

#system clipboard
copying/pasting from the system clipboard will not work if :echo has('clipboard') returns 0.
#Make Vim use the system clipboard as the default register
If your version of Vim supports both the +clipboard and +xterm_clipboard features, then you might prefer to use this setting instead:

if has('unnamedplus')
  set clipboard=unnamed,unnamedplus
endif

Vim has extended vi to allow use of the * register as a reference to the system clipboard. So we can use normal mode commands like: "*dd or 1G"*yG to copy things into the * register and "*p to paste text from it. We can also use this * register with the ex yank command, so :%y * will accomplish the same goal as gg"*yG (copy all text into the system clipboard so it can be pasted into an X or MS Windows application).
e.g.
nnoremap <C-Tab> :bn<CR>  #buffer next
nnoremap <C-S-Tab> :bp<CR>  #buffer previous
vim ~/.zshrc ~/.zsh-func

X11-clipboard support in terminal
Getting Vim to work with the X11 clipboard can be a struggle, at least when you like to run Vim in a terminal. The GUI version of Vim always has clipboard support, however, if you like to use Vim from a terminal, you will have to check for X11-clipboard support.

From the console, type:
% vim --version
If you see "+xterm_clipboard", you are good to go. If it's "-xterm_clipboard", you will need to look for a version of Vim that was compiled with clipboard support.

u: undo last change (can be repeated to undo preceding commands)
Ctrl-R: Redo changes which were undone (undo the undos). Compare to '.' to repeat a previous change, at the current cursor position. Ctrl-R will redo a previously undone change, wherever the change occurred.
A related command is:
U: return the last line which was modified to its original state (reverse all changes in last modified line)
U is not actually a true "undo" command as it does not actually navigate undo history like u and CTRL-R. This means that (somewhat confusingly) U is itself undo-able with u; it creates a new change to reverse previous changes.
U is seldom useful in practice, but is often accidentally pressed instead of u, so it is good to know about.

#http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Moving_to_matching_braces
% key can be used for the following:
    To jump to a matching opening or closing parenthesis, square bracket or a curly brace: ([{}])
    To jump to start or end of a C-style comment: /* */.
    To jump to a matching C/C++ preprocessor conditional: #if, #ifdef, #else, #elif, #endif.
    To jump between appropriate keywords, if supported by the ftplugin file, for example, between begin and end in a Pascal program. 

A nice keymap is:
noremap % v%

This way, whenever you type % you jump to the matching object, and you visually select all the text in between. It's useful for indenting a C/C++ method/class: go to opening/closing brace, and type =%
«end of % »

#delete from current position until <x>
dtx deletes from current position till just before x. Just tx moves the cursor to just before character x in current line.
To delete up to and including the space, use df<space>.

#vim \r \n
From http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace :
When Searching
...
\n is newline, \r is CR (carriage return = Ctrl-M = ^M)
When Replacing
...
\r is newline, \n is a null byte (0x00).

delete word around cursor in VIM:
To delete all characters between two whitespaces, in normal mode: daW
To delete just one word:
daw : delete the word under the cursor    
caw : delete the word under the cursor and put you in insert mode 
'a' specifies that the deletion is to include a delimiter
To delete the entire word your cursor is on and to put you in insert mode use ciw
If the cursor is inside the word:
diw to delete in the word (doesn't include spaces)
daw to delete around the word (includes spaces before the next word).

edit multiple files in Vim:
vim file1, :e file2, :bn, :bn, :bw
Commands to switch between buffers:
:bf            # Go to first file.
:bl            # Go to last file
:bn            # Go to next file.
:bp            # Go to previous file.
:bw            # Close file.
:help buffer to find more information
To know filename use Ctrl+G,:file or :f
