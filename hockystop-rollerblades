How to Hockey Stop on Rollerblades (How to parallel slide)

Hockey stop on ice: lower your posture during the approach with weight distributed over the middle of the skates, turn the lead plant leg's skate 90 degrees while shifting the weight from the middle of the foot to the heel, sink all of your weight onto the lead leg's heel (if doing on just one leg) or like 75% of your weight on the lead leg's heel and the rest on the trail legs heel (if doing on both skates), your hips and shoulders should naturally immediately follow in turning. The deeper you're "sitting" (butt's lower to ground with deep knee bend), as you're stabilizing yourself after the more balanced you'll be coming out of it. You'll have to be lower the faster you're going during the approach, as well. This process digs the edges of the plant leg(s) into the ice which literally scrapes a thin layer of ice off, providing gradual friction that brings you to a stop.

I don't inline much, but on most surfaces, if you do it exactly like on ice, you'll tip over because the wheels don't dig in, although with some softer wheels, perhaps a bit of the wheel gets worn off, providing gradual frictions that makes a slide possible.

Without special wheels or smoother surfaces, like on asphalt with hard wheels, you'll have to "C cut" much wider on the approach with the lead leg, and sort of segue into the 90 degree rotation as you're skate's coming out of the "top" of the "C" in the "C cut". Your lead foot should be out a bit more in front of the rest of your body, with that foot's lower leg about 45 degrees from the ground (as opposed to a stop on ice where the lead foot is barely in front of you and that foot's lower leg is closer to 70-90 degrees off the ground), and then you really have to sink you weight down and absorb the resistance from the road and your wheels with your ankles, knees, thighs, etc since neither the road or wheels have any give. The lower your butt is and the deeper your knee bend throughout, the lower your center of gravity (which makes is less likely you'll topple forward) and the more strength you can get out of your legs and glutes.
